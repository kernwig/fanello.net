Switcher! is a two-fold programmer's
utility for the Commodore 128. With
it, you can easily swap between two
independant 80c screens, and have up
to 7 BASIC programs in memory at once
for editing.

This file is a BASIC loader program,
which creates the ML file in whatever
area of memory you wish. This allows
Switcher! to coexist with other
utilities in memory.

Switcher is freeware from Bugsoft.
