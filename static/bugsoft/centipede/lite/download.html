  Centipede Lite Download
</H1>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<B>The Centipede Lite BBS software is contained within six 'LiBraRy' archive
files. Each archives contains a selection of files that compose Centipede
Lite. In addition the six .LBR files, you need a
<A HREF="downloads/library">Library</A> utility. In order to dissolve the
files, you will either need two storage units, or one large enough to hold
at least 860 blocks of data. If you can not do this, then you do not have
enough room to run Centipede Lite anyway. Sorry. :(</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<B>Dissolve the archive "manual.lbr" to its own disk or directory first.
On a Commodore 128 and an 80 column display, run the "run me" program. It
will allow you to view and/or print the Centipede Lite manual. Everything
that you need to know is in there.<BR>

<B>Thank you for trying Centipede Lite,<BR>
