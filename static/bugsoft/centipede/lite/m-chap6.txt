6 - Using Add-Ons [NAL]

Centipede was designed to support easily installed add-on systems. [NAL] Two
general types of add- ons are games and networks. Other add-ons may add any
sort of added functionality you can think of.


6.1 - About Network Add-Ons

Centipede supports the use of up to ten message network systems. When
installed, these networks are seamlessly inserted into the e-mail and message
board systems. Replies to both public and private messages are automatically
routed to the correct network. A list of nodes, on all networks, is available
to send new e-mail. 

At the time of this writing, there are three networks available for Centipede:

     ComLink - a centralized network consisting of shared message categories
               and e-mail across V128 and Centipede BBSs.
     CommNet - a distributed network consisting of shared message categories
               and e-mail across several BBS programs. [NAL]
     Net64 -   the Color 64 Network - a system of independently connected BBSs
               with e-mail and limited public messaging abilities. [NAL]


6.1.1 - What is ComLink?

ComLink is a centralized, message-oriented network for Commodore BBSs. Entire
message categories are sent to a central hub, run by Bugsoft, which
distributes the messages to all nodes in the Link. E-Mail can also be sent to
any user on any node in the 'Link. The entire transfer is done in only a few
minutes, with a single call from your BBS to the Hub system.

In order to use the ComLink system, you must subscribe to the Hub service. The
price is kept low, running about the same price as a magazine subscription.
With a magazine, you receive information once a month. With ComLink, you
receive and send information every day! It's quite a deal!

Once a night, your BBS will automatically call the ComLink Hub (located in
California) at a time of your choosing. New messages are exchanged and then
you are quickly disconnected. Depending on your baud rate and current
activity, a call to the ComLink hub generally lasts only one to three minutes.

ComLink is already built into Centipede Lite. For information on how to
subscribe ComLink, please refer to the ComLink manual "comlink.dox".
