<A NAME="announce"><!-- --></A><I>This message was originally posted on V128's
ComLink network on January 30th, 1995, as an announcement to all Color 64
and Version 128 SysOps.</I>
<H3>
  FROM THE BEGINNING...
</H3>
<P>
I started on a c128 version of Color 64, four years ago, because as a programmer,
I liked Color 64's flexibility and large selection of mods and games, but
wanted to use c128 mode. Initially all V128 was, was Color 64 running in
c128 mode. That made it faster, and let us add more mods without worry of
running out of memory. V128 has evolved greatly since its first release three
years ago. Myself and others, have added feature upon feature to V128, in
the forms of both mods and upgrades. It has surpassed its Color 64 heritage,
and become a far more powerful entity. Unfortunately, this same heredity
that V128 originally used as a crutch to launch it into rapid popularity,
is now serving as shackles, limiting it from full maturity and expansion.
<P>
First, V128 must be built upon an operating Color 64 system. Initially, this
helped earn easy converts over from Color 64, to the new software. But now,
it only serves to complicate setting up a new system. In order to use V128,
a new SysOp must first get Color 64, then convert it to V128, then pile on
layer after layer of mods and upgrades, just to achieve was is commonly
considered a base system. This does not make a very marketable product. While
a freeware Color 64 can help with much of this problem, this one dilemma
is not the entire story.
<P>
Color 64's, and thus V128's, base code is obsolete and difficult to work
with! When Greg Pfountz started splitting the system into separate overlays,
about a decade ago, he was using cutting edge programming. However, overlays
are bulky and inefficient in their repetitive code and long loading times.
While the onset of hard drives have assisted to minimize this problem, it
still remains. Color 64 was created to run on floppy drives. Now hard drives,
with sub-directories and fast access, are the norm. The difficulty of working
with Color 64 and V128 systems is that they have undergone so many changes
since the basic structure was created. One of the prime reasons V128 has
yet to have a functional Ymodem protocol, is due to the absolute mess of
the upload and download BASIC coding. It is what we programmers call "spaghetti
code." It's all a big jumble of branching around and "hacks" to add features
and fixes, all the way back to when Greg Pfountz added multi-Punter!
<P>
All of V128's layers and layers of mods, even once all merged in, leads to
conflicts. There is just too much code, fighting over the same lines and
the same variables. It all leads to conflicts. This is all especially difficult
for those who don't consider themselves programmers. I spend much of my time
helping people track down conflicts between mods. We aren't just running
one BBS program here. This is V128 plus a mesh of mods, upgrades and "hacks."
What is needed, is a fresh start. A new system, and a new standard. One that
has what we all want built in, and lets you add what YOU want, without worry
of conflicts. A system with a base flexibility that can have every system
look and act completely different, without changing a single line of BASIC.
And, a system that is built on a base structure, designed and intended to
be expanded upon. What we need, is Centipede!
<H3>
  BACKING UP A LITTLE...
</H3>
<P>
I recognized the need for this system long ago, as did all those who nagged
me to write it. But I didn't want to leave Color 64. It is the base of V128's
being, and what I had learned to blindly love. Things started to change when
Fred Ogle ended Color 64 v7.3's life on the market. He believed he was serving
the fatal blow to V128. He'd be kicking himself now to learn his act was
the catalyst to the next evolutionary step for Color 64 and V128!
<P>
My original intent was to make "System V128," which was described as Color
64 v7.3 with V128 and many of the existing V128 mods built in as standard
features. This would include a new manual that would combine Color 64's and
V128 into a single work. Had I stuck to that plan, System V128 would probably
be out by now. But I didn't. Before going too far into System V128, I asked
for input from existing V128 owners via a survey of twenty-one questions.
The results were startling! More people than I had expected had realized
the need for a larger overhaul. EVERY respondent was ready and willing to
scrap their hard fought for main overlays, for new ones. This support from
my customers gave me the push to start seriously considering some more drastic
steps in improving V128. I started with a new menu structure based upon the
same concepts of the highly flexible, and highly popular G-Menu mod. With
a new, fully customizable menu and command structure, I began to modularize
the BBS. Initially, I simply starting with what would have been System V128,
and rearranging and renumbering code into smaller modules. I then saw the
use in multiple layers of modules. Then levels of variable killers. Then
I started discovering some secrets of Commodore BASIC: Hidden variables,
great speed increases via less individual variables and arrays, and reading
variables in as program code rather than from sequential files. Even the
machine language began to modularize for easy additions. A new BBS program
was forming before my eyes. Past suggestions, thoughts, and experiences flowed
from my hands onto paper and keyboard alike. Simply assimilating it all into
a manageable form took a couple of weeks! The resulting code that I am now
laboriously typing out will be, Centipede. It's the system you've always
wanted. A system whose abilities include what I have talked about here, plus
so much more, while STILL running all those hundreds of on-line games that
have been written for Color 64 and V128 over the past decade!
<P>
I had intended to wait until Centipede was in beta testing before composing
this message. Unfortunately, with little information comes the rumors,
misunderstandings and fears. I'd like to conclude this message with my assurances
that I am NOT dumping Version 128 or Color 64! Those systems are, in essence,
the father and grandfather of Centipede. Centipede may be the new kid on
the block, but I will not forget its proud lineage. I will continue to provide
Color 64 and V128 support and V128 sells up to and following the release
of Centipede.
<P>
As always, your suggestions and questions are not only welcome, but actively
solicited. Thank you for taking the time to read this message.<BR>

<A NAME="details"><!-- --></A><I>The message was originally posted on V128's
ComLink network on February 20th, 1995. Much has changed from these early
development days, but much is also the same...</I><BR>
------------------------
<P>
There has been many questions (prodding actually) on some specifics about
Centipede... so I am typing up some here from my notes. I have two notebooks
and a disk box of 4x5" cards full of data. One notebook has the computer's
memory map, and the other contains BASIC variables and file formats. The
cards describe each BASIC overlay and module, and, each script, machine language,
and variables file. The following is information from these notes. While
in some sort of order in my notes (usually numeric or alphabetic), they will
probably appear to be random by topic. Some will be general ideas, some specific
programming techniques, and whatever else comes to mind. Information will
be presented at all levels of expertise. Some may require detailed programming
knowledge, some Color 64 or V128 knowledge, and some nothing beyond what
you already know about telecommunications. It's all mixed together here.
I'm leaving it up to you to get what you can out of it all. This should answer
many of your questions, while doubtlessly creating new ones. (Sigh.) ;)
<P>
----------------------
<P>
The c128 has two TOD (time-of-day) clocks. Color 64 uses only one of them
for, you guessed it, the time of day. It uses what is called the jiffy-clock
for keeping track of time online or idle time. The jiffy-clock, however,
is not very accurate. Centipede uses the second TOD clock to keep the jiffy-clock
accurate. Thus we have the accuracy of a TOD clock, with the ease of use
of the jiffy-clock.
<P>
I haven't done anything on it yet, but I hope to use the extra 48k of those
with 64k of video RAM for the local buffer. Your users have a buffer in their
term program, why shouldn't you? V128 uses whatever space is left over in
the BASIC program area for the buffer, and Centipede will continue to do
so for those of us with only 16k of video RAM.
<P>
SwiftLink support will be included in the basic package.
<P>
Also in planning, is BURST mode reading of SEQ files on Burst compatible
drives, and direct access to the SCSI drive on Lt.Kernal systems. Both offer
incredible speed increases. Oh.. also for downloading files.
<P>
A 26th screen line will be added at the bottom, containing a little info
on the current user online. This will be in addition to the (modified) SysOp
View Panel will full detail that you can bring up at almost any time without
notice to the user online.
<P>
Centipede will not be running in 40c mode. Users can of course still call
in 40c and Centipede will use a simulated 40c screen, but still be in RGB
mode. Supporting two screens creates a small slow-down and puts some memory
out of use, as well as creating other programming headaches. I've yet to
find anyone to continue running V128 on a composite screen for a great length
of time, so I'm dropping that.
<P>
Split screen chat mode is of course in here, and I'm working on a full-screen
editor.
<P>
File transfer protocol ML files are self-serving. What I man by that is that
they handle any details specific to their own protocol internally, so that
you can mix and match any file xfer protocols into your bbs, without any
modification to BASIC. If you don't want to run all the protocols, you don't
have to, and any new protocols can be added simply by copying them to your
HD and adding them in the Protocol Maintenance area.
<P>
Text can be output to the modem by why of a modified basic PRINT command.
Instead of Color 64's a$="text":sysc(0) to output a string, you may use
[print"text" instead. The old Color 64 commands still work, but the new Centipede
way gives us the full flexibility of the print command, including PRINT USING
formatting.
<P>
Color 64's sysc(5) and sysc(8) (input strings from disk and modem) are
supplemented to put the results in any string you want, rather than just
tx$. To read a complete seq file into the a$() array: a=0 : do until st :
a=a+1 : sysc(8):=a$(a) : loop
<P>
One overlay and up to three levels of modules may be in memory at a time.
So the list of files in memory may look like: "ovl.main", "mdl.upload",
"mdl.ud-dir". (I couldn't find any example using all four levels, but it's
nice to have it available.) You may also have two modules of the same level
in memory at once using a technique of 'hiding' one of them. This allows
you to sort-of 'gosub' to a routine in another module. Such as uploading
from the email module.
<P>
Which brings me to private files transfers. You 'e-mail' a private file to
another user, by attaching an upload to a piece of mail. A use may have any
number of private files at a time. They are held or deleted with the email
they are attached to.
<P>
Files can be copied between two drives or the same one, by opening the two
files, and executing a single SYS call.
<P>
A SYS call lets you set the cursor at any line and column on the screen.
The ML finds the shortest path there in c/g, or pops you directly there for
ANSI callers.
<P>
Another SYS lets you scan a file for a specific character.
<P>
Centipede has four individual levels of dim and variable killers.
<P>
Translation routines for ASCII, Commodore color/graphics, and ANSI are separate
ML files. New ones can be easily added.
<P>
Overall variable structure has been changed a bit. Many individual variables
from Color 64 have been moved into one of two arrays: d%() and d$(). Using
d$(2) may not be as clear as pw$ for the user's password, but it's a trade
off for memory and speed. BASIC's ROM code can calculate the exact memory
location of an array index much faster than it can do a sequential search
through every variable name in search of an individual variable. Continuing
the same example, d$(2) has a three-byte overhead in the variable space,
while pw$ uses seven! More commonly used variables such as lv for the user's
level were left alone.
<P>
There is a maximum of 15 message bases, with 26 categories in each.
<P>
Create your own menus. Sample ones will be included as starting points. Starting
with the main menu and standard sysop menu, you can define every hotkey to
run whatever routine you like, including other menus! Hence, sub menus. Each
hotkey has the following attributes: command name, access level, killer type
(dim or variable), graphics requirements, filename of module or overlay,
routine number in that module, and new program and support files directories
to use in that routine.
<P>
Scripts of up to 25 lines use the same attributes for loading modules as
menus, plus can display seq files and display and respond to simple Y/N prompts.
<P>
Directory locations, as mentioned above, can be modified from their defaults
from menu options. Each location is defined by it's device number (8-15),
file prefix, and one or two disk commands. The prefix option is particularly
useful for CMD owners, who can create prefixes such as "3:/msgbase2/" for
the second message base on partition #3, in the subdirectory msgbase2. You
can also send the two commands of "cp3" and "cd//msgbase2", but I'm told
the prefix method is faster.
<P>
Users can set their own experience levels between: Beginner, Knowledgeable,
and Expert. This effects things such as the detail of help automatically
shown at menus and prompts.
<P>
Users may setup their own default message base scans to read or skip any
message bases they wish, automatically.
<P>
You may lock users out of any message base or u/d category, regardless of
their access level. You may also set daily time limit adjustments for each
user, which will give them more or less time than normal at their access
level.
<P>
Short-View file descriptions in the directory listing (up to 38 characters)
offers more detail than a little 16 character file name. Users may select
whether or not they wish to have them displayed. This only supplement the
full detailed file descriptions in the Color 64 style.
<P>
Caller log and variables are saved right after user logs off, rather than
after five minutes of idle time. At present, the idle script is only used
for calling networks, and time for this script can be set between one and
sixty minutes.
<P>
Screen savers are separate modules, making for easy changing screen savers.
You may also select the delay for the saver to kick in, between one and fifteen
minutes, or not at all.
<P>
You set multiplication factors for credits awarded for downloading and uploading.
Using this, you can select whether a user gets credits right away for uploading
something, or when somebody downloads their upload, or a combination of the
two.
<P>
If you so setup your menus, you can allow users to flag files for download
while viewing a directory listing. Up to 50 files may be flagged, from any
combination of directories.
<P>
Flags indicate if your modem supports DTR, if you wish the BBS to take the
modem off-hook when you are using it, and if you are using a SwiftLink. Baud
rates supported are 300-4800 on the rs-232 port, and 300-38400 with SwiftLink.
<P>
You may select whether or not you want Menu Phrases shown for each menu,
and phrases are accessed faster than V128's Prompt Macros are.
<P>
There is built-in support for Network 64 v1.26, and ComLink.
<P>
You may enter a line of any misc information about a user in their account
record. There is also a field for a real name, if you allow handles, for
possible support of other networks in the future that demand real names.
<P>
You may use a local mode password to keep house guest from getting into areas
of the BBS they should not be poking around in.
<P>
Will us the proper terminology of "RETURN" or "ENTER" depending on the user's
graphics mode.
<P>
Menu hotkeys and levels when reading messages are customizable: Quit, reply
in public, private reply, reread previous, reread last, skip forward, skip
backward, jump thread, backup a thread, jump category, non-stop read, post
in other thread or begin new one, scratch, edit, move, scratch thread, change
thread subject, download message.
<P>
Mailbox email reading hotkeys are also customizable: Edit user's account
(level 9 only), reread same, backup one, delete, hold, reply, download, quit.
<P>
And finally, the message editor commands: Attach a file (email only), quote
from reference msg, upload msg, full-screen edit, continue line edit, clear
msg, list lines, edit lines, delete lines, insert lines, send, abort.
<P>
There are up to 15 U/D categories with up to 26 directories in each. Each
directory has the attributes: name, disk location, allow downloads, allow
uploads, access level.
<P>
Caller log is more flexible than Color 64. The log for the current call is
stored in a 'hidden' variable array, so as to not create any variable conflicts.
The permanent log is stored in a REL file, of which you define the length.
The REL format allows for fast searches and viewing in either direction.
It also saves memory.
<P>
Support for dual-lined system on multiplexed Lt.Kernal. (And CMD HD if CMD
ever makes a real multiplexer.)
<P>
Rewritten, faster, message threading, message regeneration, and u/d directory
regeneration routines than Color 64 or V128.
<P>
File transfer protocols: ascii, Xmodem Checksum, CRC, and 1k, Ymodem and
Ymodem-Batch, and Punter and Mutli-Punter.
<P>
In addition to the old Color 64 message subject for a thread (now called
a thread name), the users may change the message TOPIC field for each message.
Message headers in the file contain only the data. The actual header format
is created via BASIC, and can be modified. Two columns are used for 80c users.
<P>
A modem module handles initializing, answering, hanging up, on/off hook,
baud rates, and other modem commands. Specialized modules can be created
for each modem type.
<P>
Date and Time can be read from a CMD device, or entered manually.
<P>
Variables can be stored in program form and quickly loaded (much faster than
reading from a SEQ file) and can be easily modified by putting the changes
in an array and GOSUBing to a routine. For those who are familiar with them,
it is similar to .INI files under Microsoft Windows.
<P>
Here is some of the features of V128 that I ran across in my notes, while
are defiantly still a part of Centipede: Split screen chat mode, local buffer,
SysOp View Panel, Programmable function keys, RAMDOS support, MCI, Superes
detect and ANSI auto-detect, auto-pause (may expand on it), digitation player,
ANSI translation, Sim40c, Message threading (although handled in a faster
manor), MembVars, plus pretty much everything else I forgot to mention.
<P>
<P>
Yow! That was all quite a book! You asked for it though. ;)

solicited. Thank you for taking the time to read this message.
