<FONT size=+2><B>Welcome to Bugsoft.</B></FONT><BR>
<CENTER>
  <BIG><B>Bugsoft</B> is an endeavor by
  <A HREF="http://www.fanello.net/adam">Adam "Ant" Fanello</A>, with some help
  of others, to create software for the masses, just for the fun of it. Sometimes,
  we even manage to make a little money doing it!</BIG>
  <P>
  <A NAME="org"><!-- --></A><BIG> As you can see by looking at this
  <A HREF="orgchart.html">Bugsoft Organizational Listing</A>, Bugsoft isn't
  a big corporation, nor is there any attempt at becoming one. We all have
  <I>real</I> jobs, and just do this because we are insane. </BIG>
  <P>
  <BIG>Past major projects from <B>Bugsoft</B> have included Color 64's Version
  128 BBS, Centipede BBS and the ComLink network. Many smaller programs have
  also been created by Bugsoft, a few of which are offered for
  <A HREF="freeware/index.html">free downloading</A> from this site. Most of
  these past projects have dealt with the Commodore 128 computer.</BIG>
  <P>
  <BIG>Bugsoft is looking to take a <B>leap forward</B> about 15 years, with
  upcoming cross-platform projects using <B>Java technology</B>.</BIG>

  <P>
  <BIG>So why the name <B>Bugsoft</B>?!</BIG>
  <P>
  <BIG> The name was first conceptualized as a joke - based on the nick-name
  used by its founder "Ant". The name stuck though, not only to show a sense
  of humor (and to deflate sometimes over blown egos), but as a sign of
  <B>Bugsoft</B>'s commitment to only producing <B>quality</B> software. </BIG>
  <P>
  <BIG> <I>"Bugs <B>work</B> for us!"<BR>
  "No unauthorized bugs allowed!"</I></BIG>
  <P>
  <BIG>Who better to catch a bug than another bug! It's silly, yes. But Bugsoft's
  chief programmer, Ant, prides himself on being able to <I>think</I> like
  a bug, and so he can track down and exterminate those software bugs like
  no other! (Some think he's nuts, but it works, so we don't argue.)<BR>
  <B>Most importantly</B> though, <B>Bugsoft</B> carefully <I>engineers</I>
  programs, rather than <I>hacking</I>, to create code that is <I>efficient,
  solid, and inhospitable to software bugs</I>. </BIG>
