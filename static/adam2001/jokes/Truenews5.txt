Subject: Breakfast ... or is it ... ??

I was sat in the pub with a few friends, playing pool and whatever, when 
someone asked me whether I'd made a move with a girl I fancied. The landlord
took us up on this, and said "I'll give you the one chat-up line she can't
give you a snotty response to". Okay, said I. He told me to get her alone,
put my arm round her, kiss her gently on the cheek, and whisper in her ear :
"How do you like your eggs in the morning ??"

To which a voice came from the other side of the table :

   "Unfertilised".

[Source of the question as far as I know is Ian Warren, the landlord of my 
local.

my university. But someone's got to be a chemistry undergraduate, I spose..
I don't think it's original, but it's funny, I reckon].

You should have seen the bulletin posted outside of our Auditorium...
 Our school is performing the play "Annie", and it is the Broadway version
without Daddy Warbucks' bodyguard Punjab. So on the door it said "Sorry, no
Punjabs". You should have seen the review THAT one got in the local newspaper.

I saw the following classified ad in the computer section of one of the
local newspapers, March 21, 1991.  I can't remember the exact words; so
I paraphrase:

 For sale/trade: computer freak with all
 kinds of stuff, IBM/Apple/Motorola/etc.

I used to work for the Commercial Division of Honeywell, Inc. which
installed the Variable Air Volume HVAC control system in the building
to which you referred.  In a VAV system the temperature is maintained
by varying the volume of air flowing through the conditioned space,
which in turn is controlled by varying the static air pressure in the
supply ducts relative to that in the returns.  It all usually works
pretty well, but in the early days of VAV the techs who wired up the
systems were all the time forgetting to connect the return air fan,
which provides pressure relief for the air being pumped into the
space.

So when they fired up the system for the first time in the Prudential
Tower, it was like blowing up a big glass and steel balloon.  Since
the windows had been set into their frames but not cemented, out they
came.  Honeywell had to ante up plenty on that one.  Each window was
worth thousands.

This also happened at building site known as "The Pyramids" in
Indianapolis, a very avant-garde design by Kevin Roche/John Dinkleoo
Assoc. for an insurance company there.  The windows had been custom
designed and made.

Subject: Parental reflexes.

Some relatives have a 5-year old boy named Jeff who has some
speech problems which include using incorrect grammar.  So, they
put him in speech therapy.  During the early stages of treatment,
they were not supposed to correct his speech, since his
self-esteem was pretty low.  But Jeff made progress and gained
some confidence, so the rule became that they were now supposed
to correct him all the time.  This is what happened soon after.

One morning, Jeff was eating his cereal, his younger sister began
to tease him mercilessly.  Rather than fight back, he finally got
up and moved to the other side of the table, muttering, "Me not
going to take that kind of crap."  Immediately, his parents
responded in unison, "*I'm* not going to take that kind of crap."

I just heard an advertisement on the radio for "Hooked on Phonics," a
cassette base course for learning how to read.

The announcer proudly proclaims 

   "To order `Hooked on Phonics' call 1-800-ABC-DEFG now!"

I wonder if 1-800-PHO-NICS was taken...

Subject: The Menudo was REAL hot.  True story

A fire in the parking area at a menudo cookoff near San Antonio
this Sunday (3/24) destroyed over 100 automobiles.  The cookoff
was sponsored by a firefighter's association.

(Menudo is a kind of Mexican soup.  Most nonhispanics would prefer
not to know the ingredients.)

This is reported by Time magazine:  "Santa Cruz, CA: A university
of California administrator has sought to ban such phrases as
"a chink in the armor," "a nip in the air" and "call a spade a spade"
because they contain words that in other contexts have been used to
express prejudice."
