It's amazing -- the insights provided by
some basic mathematical truths...

I got this from a friend of mine.  Enjoy...

      After applying some simple algebra to some trite phrases and
cliches a
      new understanding can be reached of the secret to wealth and
success.

      Here it goes.

          Knowledge is Power
          Time is Money and as every engineer knows,
          Power is Work over Time.

      So, substituting algebraic equations for these time worn bits of
wisdom,
      we get:
          K = P    (1)
          T = M    (2)
          P = W/T  (3)

      Now, do a few simple substitutions:

          Put W/T in for P in equation (1), which yields:
          K = W/T  (4)

      Put M in for T into equation (4), which yields:

          K = W/M  (5).

      Now we've got something.  Expanding back into English, we get:

         Knowledge equals Work over Money.

      What this MEANS is that:

         1. The More You Know, the More Work You Do, and
         2. The More You Know, the Less Money You Make.


      Solving for Money, we get:

         M = W/K  (6)
         Money equals Work Over Knowledge.

      From equation (6) we see that Money approaches infinity as
Knowledge
      approaches 0, regardless of the Work done.

      What THIS MEANS is:

         The More you Make, the Less you Know.

      Solving for Work, we get

         W = M x K  (7)
         Work equals Money times Knowledge

      From equation (7) we see that Work approaches 0 as Knowledge
      approaches 0.

      What THIS MEANS is:

          The stupid rich do little or no work.


      Working out the socioeconomic implications of this breakthrough is
left
      as an exercise for the reader.
