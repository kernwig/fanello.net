In the spirit of Christmas...

Santa was very cross.  It was Christmas Eve and NOTHING was going right.

Mrs. Claus had burned all the cookies.  The elves were complaining about
not getting paid for the overtime they had while making the toys.  The
reindeer had been drinking all afternoon and were dead drunk.  To make
matters worse, they had taken the sleigh out for a spin earlier in the day
and had crashed it into a tree.

Santa was furious.  "I can't believe it!  I've got to deliver millions of
presents all over the world in just a few hours - all of my reindeer are
drunk, the elves are on strike and I don't even have a Christmas tree!  I
sent that stupid Little Angel out HOURS ago to find a tree and he isn't
even back yet!  What am I going to do?"

Just then, the Little Angel opened the front door and stepped in from
the snowy  night, dragging a Christmas tree.  He says "Yo, fat man! Where
do you want me to stick the tree this year?"


And thus the tradition of angels atop the Christmas trees came to 
pass........
