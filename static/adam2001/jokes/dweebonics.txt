TOP TEN SIGNS YOUR KID IS TAKING DWEEBONICS CLASSES

Who said that Ebonics is the only kind of nonstandard English schools
need to know about? School boards in Silicon Valley have already adopted
a course for the pocket protector set without telling anyone. There's
only one way to find out if your kids are learning this stuff, moms and
dads. Watch for these telltale signs your children are studying
Dweebonics:

10. They tilt their head sideways to smile.
9.  When you ground them, they say, "Your UI could really use some work."
8.  They say, "My dad can beat your dad at Quake."
7.  Instead of laughing, they say, "LOL."
6.  They insult kids by saying, "And you've got limited bandwidth!"
5.  They change the answering machine message to "BRB, leave your URL, and
    we'll TTYL."
4.  This is how they ask someone out on a date: "Umm, uh, well...see ya!"
3.  Calling from camp, your homesick child says, "I'm roaming outside my
    service area!"
2.  When you ask if they've finished their book report, they say, "It's in
    beta, but it'll ship in time."
1.  You're telling them something they don't want to hear.  They're saying,
    "NAK, NAK, NAK" the whole time.
