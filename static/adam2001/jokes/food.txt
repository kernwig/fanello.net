                         Arguably Edible Sustenance

Throughout history, many cooks were given the responsibility of
simultaneously stretching limited food reserves while preparing a meal that
everyone could keep down. Somewhere along the way the role of cook became
more of a submissive position where unhealthy, unsustainable resources
(i.e. beef) were squandered and salted so that the family could develop
intestinal cancer in time for the night's parade of network sitcoms. This
trend seems to be decreasing of late, and to further its demise, we offer a
few post- modernistic recipes for the fiscally challenged. There is room
for you to post your own cheap recipe at the bottom. Please do.

Before we get to the food, let's talk a bit about equipment.

  1. Gas burners are a necessity. Open flame is a must for every kitchen.
  2. Deep Frier. It's gross, dangerous, and unhealthy. And those are the
     good points.
  3. Sandwich makers rule! Those foldover toasty things are pretty cheap
     and make snacks for pennies (sound like an infomercial?).
  4. Big, sharp butcher knife. This is what really makes cooking fun.
  5. Iron skillet. Don't EVER wash it. It'll rust, and plus, the flavor
     builds up in layers when you don't.
  6. Wooden spoon. Yawn.
  7. Steel pot. Yawn.
  8. Sausage Maker (Optional)

These things are all you'll ever need to cook with. Ever. Period.
