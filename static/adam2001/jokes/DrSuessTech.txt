WHAT IF DR. SEUSS DID TECHNICAL WRITING? 

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, and the bus is interrupted 
as a very last resort, and the address of the memory makes your floppy disk 
abort, then the socket packet pocket has an error to report. 

If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash, and the 
double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, and 
your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash, then your 
situation's hopeless and your system's gonna crash! 

If the label on the cable on the table at your house, says 
the network is connected to the button on your mouse, but your packets want 
to tunnel on another protocol, that's repeatedly rejected by the printer 
down the hall, and your screen is all distorted by the side effects of 
gauss, so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,then you may as 
well reboot and go out with a bang, 'cause as sure as I'm a poet, the 
sucker's gonna hang! 

When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk, and the 
microcode instructions cause unnecessary risk, then you have to flash your 
memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM.  Quickly turn 
off the computer and be sure to tell your mom.
