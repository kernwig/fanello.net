which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will

Subject: Christmas ornaments

My girlfriend and I were sitting on the floor going through an old box
of Christmas ornaments that my parents had given me.  When I got up,
my girlfriend began to laugh, uproariously.  After several minutes of
her laughing and me not knowing why, she reached over and pulled a small
label off of my behind that had fallen from the box.  It read:

 "Retired ornaments, do not use."

Hey, who says Immigration Authorities don't have a sense of humor ?

At the border when I entered the US from Canada, I was stopped for a
routine check. The officer asked me mundane questions and asked me
for my passport. As he was glancing through it he was asking me more
questions and his preoccupation with scrutinizing the passpost was
getting more and more evident, finally culminating into this question -
"Can I look at some identification ?"

My eyes lit up and I didn't even get time to get over the stupidity  
his question embodied, before which he said, "Well... I guess this
would do" and pointed at the passport he was holding.

[The Background]

Back in high school, a good friend of mine threw one heck of a party.
It was the typical parents-gone-out-of-town party, and quite a LOT of
people were invited.   Like most other parties of this nature, this
one was conceived the minute the parents in question told their son
"Now John, NO PARTIES while we're away...".

[The Scene that night]

It was quite the party.  The beer flowed by the gallon, and everyone
got pretty hammered.  One young fellow, feeling a little sick, decided
that he better go outside and lay down a while.

The problem was, however, that he decided to lay down on the NEIGHBOR'S
back yard.  The owner, an elderly lady, did what anyone else in her
situation would do-- upon seeing the body on the lawn, she called the 
rescue  squad.   As you can well imagine, the sound of sirens in front 
of the party caused quite a panic. The keg was hidden, the glasses of beer
were hidden, and everyone soon had a can of soda in their hands.  Had
any police come in, they would have found a pretty innocent-looking
party.  (We assumed of course, that the sirens were the cops coming
to "bust" our little affair...)

We lucked out.  No police, and the rescue squad soon left, after awakening
the young man on the lawn.  Everyone found their beers again, and the
party resumed...

[The next 2 days]

John's parents were gone for several days, so we had a pretty good
opportunity to help clean the house.  We vacuumed the rug.  We vacuumed
the drapes.  We found the empty (and half-empty) glasses of beer
and disposed of them.  We scrubbed the floors.   All in all, the house
was cleaner NOW than before John's parents left.

[The day the parents returned]

John was at work that afternoon, and decided to call home to welcome
his parents from their trip.  The conversation went something like
this:

"Hi mom.  Welcome back!  How was your trip?"

 "Good.  How was your party?"

"Um... party?  What gave you the idea that I had a party?"

 "I found a half-empty glass of beer sitting at the bottom
  of the washing machine......  "

Subject: more BASIC humor

Teaching a BASIC/Data Processing course years ago, I had a good student
taking a test who couldn't remember the answers to two questions about
different kinds of chips: RAM and ROM. The question asked which type was
volitile and which was non-volitile. Improvising, he responded:

Which kind of memory is volitile: my brain
Which is non-volitile:            my notes

From the Ottawa Citizen, an Article by Michael Farber, a Montreal

The organizing committee [for the winter Olympics] (COJO) in conjunction 
with the World Health Organization, has declared these the first non-
smoking Olympics. Sort of.  The motto of the Games is "Smoking is not my 
nature," but an accompanying COJO statement reads, "All venues are to be 
non-smoking except for venues that have smoking."

From the Ottawa Citizen, an Article by Michael Farber, a Montreal 
Gazette reporter:

The IOC is using a new saliva test to determine the sex of athletes.
Instead of verifying the double-X chromosome found in females by the
Barr test that IOC adopted 25 years ago, it test for the Y chromosome
found in males.  The test has been developed by a French doctor,
Bernard Dingeon.

In Calgary four years ago, one competitor failed the Barr test, but was
declared a woman after a physical examination.

The "What is courage?" story may be urban legend, but here is one that 
is not.

About four or five years ago, while I was visiting my parents, my father
read to me an answer from an exam he had given (college-level).  It 
started with a terribly misguided attempt to solve a problem, and ended 
something like this:

"This is probably nowhere close to correct. Please feel free to laugh
heartily."

Subject: Joke: Nothing more certain than death AND taxes

[From the Wall Street Journal, January 29, 1992]

The widow of a man who had been a client of Harab, Kamerow & Associates,
CPAs, Rovkville, Md., filed a return for her late husband in 1991.  Here
are excerpts from a letter addressed recently to the dead man by the 
IRS's Taxpayer Assistance Section in Atlanta:
"We are processing you gift tax return, Form 709, for calendar
year 1990 and find we need more information.  Please provide
your date of death.
"...If we do not hear from you, your account may reflect 
incomplete or incorrect information. ... If you have any questions
about this lettter, ... you may call the IRS telephone number
listed in your local directory..., but the office at the address
shown on this letter is most familiar with your case. ... We
apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused you, and 
thank you for your cooperation."
