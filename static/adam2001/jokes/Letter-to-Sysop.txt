 
Letter to the SysOp:
 

Dear SysOp:
 
You have made me so angry by not
responding to my telepathic entreaties
for information about this board, that
I have concluded that you need
some help in straightening out your
procedures for operating this BBS.
 
First, why are you wasting space on
messages to and from users other
than me?  Please get your priorities
in order.
 
Second, do you have any files on
Martian nose picking techniques?  If
not I DEMAND to know why not?  I
want to learn how to put booggers
into my MCI messages.
 
Third, why do you carry programs on
this BBS that require reading the
documentation to use correctly?  I
dont want to waste my time reading
some old instructions.
 
Fourth, why do I get a busy signal
sometimes when I call this BBS?  I
always send you a thought message to
let you know that I am about to call
so that you can clear the line,but
you don't seem to have enough
courtesy to log off other users when
I call.
 
Fifth, you have something wrong with
your system regarding the color
graphics.  I have set my profile to
color graphics repeatedly and I still
don't get any color on my monochrome
disply.   Please fix this.
 
Sixth, why don't you like me?


I'd sign this, but you should know
who I am by now.
