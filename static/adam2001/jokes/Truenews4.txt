Subject: Politically correct recycling...

This is true.  Here in Berkeley, Politically Correctness center of the galaxy,
in the physics building are recycling bins.  One for paper, one for glass,
one for cans, and one with a sign over it reading "Colored Paper".

Someone with a red felt pen changed the sign to read:

Paper of Color

BEANS: NO MORE EMBARRASSING ENCORES

If you love beans and other high-fiber foods but often pass them up
because of disconcerting sound effects, help is on the way.

A commercially produced enzyme called "Beano" (Lactaid Inc.) reduces
flatulence from gas-producing foods such as beans, lentils, peas,
broccoli, cabbage, onions and eggplant.  Made from the fungus
_Aspergillus niger_, Beano prevents flatulence by breaking down
gas-producing sugars.  You simply add about five drops of the liquid to
your first bite of an offending food - and the enzyme does the rest.
One warning: because Beano is derived from a fungus, it may cause
gastric upset in people who are allergic to molds or penicillin.

Funny thing happened today in Poli-sci...

Prof tells us that there will be a test next Wednesday -
30 multiple guess questions on material in the chapter,
videos we've watched, and classwork.

He then asked if we would like for him to tell us where
exactly the information is located.  So I piped up -
"Sure, and why don't you give us the answers as well,"
- you know, just a smartass comment.  The prof then
promptly rattled off all 30 of the answers - much too
quickly to write down, let alone realize that that was
what he was doing.

Damn - looks like it's time to start taping lectures....
or get a memory upgrade.

Subject: True story about mice

 The mouse on my Apple Macintosh jammed a day or two ago, so I
took it to pieces to see what was wrong with it. It turned out to
have a small piece of cheese wedged inside it -- I'd been using
it on the dining-room table.

 So now I know why they're called mice... our cats don't seem to
be interested in them, however, and they don't seem to make
people stand on chairs, as in early 60s sit-coms.

In his introduction of Albert Lee, the MC at a Stanford Lively Arts

once been hired by Eric Clapton to play lead guitar. He then said:
"Being hired by Eric Clapton to play lead guitar is like being hired
by Jack the Ripper to be a hit man."

I teach advanced trig and beginning calculus at VPI.  On a recent exam,
I asked students to find the limit of the fraction (sin x)/n, as n
approaches infinity.  One unfortunate student canceled the "n"'s, and
found that (sin x)/n = six.
