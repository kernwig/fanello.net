Noted Doughboy Dies

Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died Wednesday of a severe yeast
infection.  He was 71.  He was buried Friday in one of the biggest funerals
in years.  Dozens of celebrities turned out, including Mrs. Butterworth, the
California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, and the Hostess Twinkies. The
graveside was piled high with flours as longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered
the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who "never knew he was kneaded."

Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with
turnovers.  He was not considered a smart cookie, wasting much of his dough
on half-baked schemes.  Still, even as a crusty old man, he was a roll model
to millions.  Fresh is survived by his second wife.  They had two children,
and one in the oven.
