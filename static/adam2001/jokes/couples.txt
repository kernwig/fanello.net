NOVICE: Do clever men make good husbands?
SAGE: Clever men don't BECOME husbands!
 -------------------------------------
When met by a long procession of people led by a man with a dog,
Joe asked the man, "Who died?" "My Mother in law." "How?" "The dog bit
her." "Can I borrow the dog?" "Get in line."
 ----------------------------------------
A husband said to his wife, "No, I don't hate your relatives. In
fact, I like your mother-in-law better than I like mine.
 ----------------------------------------------------
WIFE: The 2 things I cook best are meat loaf and apple pie.
HUSBAND: Which is this?
 ----------------------------------------------------
NEWLYWED: Do you want dinner?
SPOUSE: Sure, what are my choices?
NEWLYWED: Yes and no.
 ---------------------------------------------------
DIET DEFINITION: The word 'stressed' makes perfect sense when you
realize it is 'desserts' spelled backwards.

A little boy asked his father, "Daddy, how much does it cost to get   
married?"
And the father replied, "I don't know, son, I'm still paying for it."
 ----------------------------------------------------
A couple came upon a wishing well. The husband leaned over, made a
wish and threw in a penny. The wife decided to make a wish, too.
But she leaned over too much, fell into the well, and drowned. The
husband was stunned for a while but then smiled and said, "It really   
works!"
 -----------------------------------------
This guy goes to a party without his wife. He hears this other guy
say to his wife "Pass the sugar, Honey." and "Pass the honey, Sugar."
He thinks this sort of speech is a good idea. So, the morning when he
and his wife are eating breakfast he says to his wife, "Pass the bacon,   
Pig."
 -----------------------------------------
First Guy (proudly): "My wife's an angel!"
Second Guy "You're lucky, mine's still alive."
 ----------------------------------------
A man said his credit card was stolen but he decided not to report
it because the thief was spending less than his wife did.
 ----------------------------------------
A couple was having a discussion about family finances. Finally the
husband exploded, "If it weren't for my money, the house wouldn't
be here!" The wife replied, "My dear, if it weren't for your money I
wouldn't be here."
 --------------------------------------
A bum asks a man for $2. The man asked, "Will you buy booze?" The
bum said, "No." The man asked, "Will you gamble it away?" The bum said,
"No." Then the man asked, "Will you come home with me so my wife
can see what happens to a man who doesn't drink or gamble?"
