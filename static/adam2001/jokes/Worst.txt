
  From Stan Lee Presents The Best of
      the Worst, Harper & Row:
 
 

         THE WORST TRANSVESTITE
 
   Camille Racource, a French woman,
dressed in men's clothing so she
could carry out her role as one of the
official executioners of Lyon, France,
during the years 1760 to 1770. She was
said to have excelled at the arts of
flogging, bone-breaking, hanging, and
beheading.
     (A truly liberated female)
 

          THE WORST LANDLORD

   In September of 1978 Paula Franer
signed a six-month lease on an
apartment.  During her stay, she was
killed in an accident.  When Paula's
mother went to retrieve her dead
daughter's $ 120 security deposit,
the landlord refused to refund the
money, claiming that Paula had broken
the lease when she died.
       (A deal is a deal)
 

        THE WORST RESIGNATION

   A disgruntled worker walked into the
office of Louis Polk, acting Public
Health Commissioner of Philadelphia,
and tendered his resignation by
chainsawing Polk's desk in half as the
horrified Polk sat there.
(Coulda been worse. Coulda been Polk)
 

        THE WORST FIREWORKS

   George Plimpton's 40 inch Roman
candle, nicknamed "Fat Man," was
supposed to break all existing records
as it exploded high over Long Island.
Instead, it fizzled out, sat there a
moment, and then blew a hole in the
ground 10 feet deep.
(Well, that probably broke some kind of
   record, too)
 

       THE WORST INVITATION

   In 1920, while William Jennings
Bryan served as American Secretary of
State, it was his job to invite the
nations of the world to the gala
opening of the Panama Canal.  Bryan
invited the Swiss to bring their
navy to the ceremony.
    (Bet they showed up late)
 

    THE WORST CONSTRUCTION JOB

   The Church of Corcuetos was under
construction for 90 years in Spain,
finally being completed in 1625. It
collapsed the day after it was
finished.
(They shouldn't have rushed the job)
 

   THE WORST ANIMAL SEX MANIACS

   When female chimpanzees are in
heat, they have ben known to have sex
upwards of 20 times a day.
(The male is known as a limp chimp)
