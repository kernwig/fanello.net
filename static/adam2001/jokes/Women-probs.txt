
Men --
      Having Trouble with Your Spouse?
 

This letter was started by men, like
yourself, in hopes of bringing relief
to other tired and discontented men.
Unlike most chain letters, this one
does not cost anything.
 
Just send a copy of this letter to
five friends who are equally
discontented and tired.  Then bundle
up your Wife, Girlfriend, or
Significant Other and send her to
the man whose name appears at the
top of the list.
 
When your name comes to the top of
the list you will receive 16,277
women! And one of them is bound to
be a helluva lot better than the
one you already have. Bear in mind,
though, that someone has sent her
to you, and be careful.
 
Don't break the Chain!!   Have Faith!!
 
One man broke the chain and got his
own wife back (with her mother).
 
 
At this writing, a friend of mine has
already received 184 women. The strain
killed him.
 
They buried him yesterday. It took
three morticians to get the smile
off his face and two days to close the
coffin!
