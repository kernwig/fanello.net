Subject: More from the One-liner Digest 

What follows are the latest entries in the one-liner file.  These are jokes
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

Subject: Movie Madness

(original, inspired by a recent r.h.f ballad on the subject)

	Those who claim that seeing things in movies does not affect what
people do in real life may have to reconsider their position:  look at
what Lorena Bobbitt did after seeing "Free Willy"...

I just heard this one today. Sorry, I have no idea of its roots.

Did you hear that Tanya Harding and Mickael Jackson are building a race track

Subject: Three Old Men!

Greetings all,

Here is a joke (of mild, but clean, humour!) that I heard on a local radio
station here in Palmerston North, New Zealand!  I have no idea where it
originally came from or if you all have heard/seen it before...

-------------------------
1st Old Man:  Gee, its windy today.

2nd Old Man:  No it's not... it's Thursday.

3rd Old Man:  Yeh, me too.  Let's go for a beer.
