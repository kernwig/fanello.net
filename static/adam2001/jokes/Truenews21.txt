Subject: Grading policy

 As classes come to a close, some professors like to lighten up their
classes a little.  One I know used a dart board for a demonstration with
student involvment.  After class the next professor came in, saw the
dartboard and quipped "It's a little early to be grading isn't it?"

My 3-year-old second cousin recently showed us the dangers of religion
at too early an age by saying:

"I know Jesus loves me 'cause Fievel tells me so."

Subject: Scots and English

I was reading the book of -The-Story-of-English- the other day, and
in the chapter on Scots (the variety of English spoken in Scotland),
I came across the following remark about William Lorimer's translation
of the New Testament into Scots:
  In Lorimer's -New-Testament- only the Devil speaks Standard English.

Subject: Church Music

I occasionally work as a soloist at a neighborhood church (which shall
remain nameless).  Last week, the musicians received a memo from the
minister detailing the sermon topics for the coming months.  The memo
included the following:

"Please try to select special music which reflects the theme of the
service as indicated below.  I will appreciate any suggestions you have
for relevant hymns and for other musical or liturgical arrangements."

I was supposed to sing the solo on Mother's Day.  The theme of the
service? "The Agony of Abortion".

So, uh, anybody know any good relevant hymns for the agony of abortion?

Subject: Is that your dog?

Based on a true story from a friend:

"The other day I'm sitting on the front steps of the community
art school where I work, talking to my friend Dave.  It's a
small school; the secretary's office is right inside the front
entrance.  The secretary (Betsy) is a nice woman but not very
attractive.

"We're sitting on the steps shooting the breeze when a scruffy-
looking man and his dog approach us.  After I pet the dog for
a while, it suddenly jumps up and runs through the open front
door into Betsy's office.  The man exclaims, "Uh oh!  Are dogs
allowed in the building?"  Dave jokes, "Don't worry, it won't
be the only one" (referring to Betsy).

"The guy goes inside to fetch his dog, and Dave and I start
chatting again.  After a while we notice that the man is taking
a long time to get his dog.  We step inside to investigate and
are greeted by Betsy who points at the scruffy-looking man and
asks, "Hey, have you guys met my husband?"

Subject: Moms and love . . .

The following is a true story:

I share an office with a number of guys, and fortunately
(or unfortunately), my parents live only a few minutes
drive away from where I work.  My mother thus never forgets
to call me at least once a day, to make sure her little baby 
is fine.

So yesterday she calls me.  My end of the conversation: 
"Hi, mom.  No, mom.  I'm fine mom.  No, I am NOT sick or tired.  
No, I haven't eaten yet.  It's okay mom.  No, you don't have to 
cook me dinner.  No, you don't have to drive here to drop it off.  
Really, I'm fine.  No, they don't work me too hard.  I'll be okay, 
mom.  No, I'm not angry, mom.  Bye, mom.  BYE, mom.  Yes, mom.  
I love you too, mom."

I hang up and my office mates are bursting with laughter.  
A few seconds later, the phone rings again.  It's my fiancee.
"Oh, hello, dear.  I'm fine, dear.  See you at five, dear."
Hang up.  My office mate Lou said, "Why do you say 'I love you
too, mom'  but not 'I love you too, dear'  ?"

"Because," I said, "My fiancee knows I love him, but my mother
is never sure."

Our Sears is undergoing a massive remodeling, which means everything in the
store is someplace else, like the men's socks with the luggage.  However,
they didn't bother moving the ceiling signs.  When they moved the women's 
lingerie, the sign above the new spot was probably more accurate 
than they wanted:

Subject: NRA's irrefutable logic.  Where is my murder vaccination?

Berkshire Eagle, October 7, 1993 page A3 (An AP story from Boston):

Guns in the home found to
 increase risk of death
-------------------------
People who keep guns at home nearly triple their chances of being
murdered, usually by friends or relatives, but fail to protect
themselves from intruders ...

The article goes on to describe how the study was conducted, summarizes
aspects of the population cross sections and conclusions of the study,
and concludes with a refutation by a representative of the NRA:

However, Paul Blackman, research coordinator at the National Rifle
Association, criticized the study ...
"These people were highly susceptible to homicide," he said.
"We know that because they were killed."

I wish I had said that.
