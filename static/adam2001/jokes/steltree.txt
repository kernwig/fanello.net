This is a true story - just happened. It was very funny as it happened. I 
hope it remains funny in print.

My wife and I were sitting on a rather nice wooden bench in the communal 
garden by my mothers flats. Because of a previous theft it was chained to 
a tree. My wife spotted the chain, looked puzzled and said "why is it
chained up?". I replied "to stop anyone from stealing it".

"Oh"  she said, apparently satisfied, then puzzled again requested "but 
who'd want to steal a tree?"
