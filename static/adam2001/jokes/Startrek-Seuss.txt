If Dr. Seuss wrote for Star Trek: the Next Generation...

Picard:
 Sigma Indri, that's the star,
 So, Data, please, how far? How far?

Data:
 Our ship can get there very fast
 But still the trip will last and last
 We'll have two days til we arrive
 But can the Indrans there survive?

Picard:
 LaForge, please give us factor nine.

LaForge:
 But, sir, the engines are offline!

Picard:
 Offline! But why? I want to go!
 Please make it so, please make it so!

Riker:
 But sir, if Geordi says we can't,
 We can't, we mustn't, and we shan't,
 The danger here is far too great!

Picard:
 But surely we must not be late!

Troi:
 I'm sensing anger and great ire.

Computer:
 Alert! Alert! The ship's on fire!

Picard:
 The ship's on fire? How could this be?
 Who lit the fire?

Riker:
 Not me.

Worf:
 Not me.

Picard:
 Computer, how long til we die?

Computer:
 Eight minutes left to say goodbye.

Data:
 May I suggest a course to take?
 We could, I think, quite safely make
 Extinguishers from tractor beams
 And stop the fire, or so it seems...

Geordi:
 Hurray! Hurray! You've saved the day!
 Again I say, Hurray! Hurray!

Picard:
 Mr. Data, thank you much.
 You've saved our lives, our ship, and such.

Troi:
 We still must save the Indran planet --

Data:
 Which (by the way) is made of granite...

Picard:
 Enough, you android. Please desist.
 We understand -- we get your gist.
 But can we get our ship to go?
 Please, make it so, PLEASE make it so.

Geordi:
 There's sabotage among the wires
 And that's what started all the fires.

Riker:
 We have a saboteur? Oh, no!
 We need to go! We need to go!

Troi:
 We must seek out the traitor spy
 And lock him up and ask him why?

Worf:
 Ask him why? How sentimental.
 I say give him problems dental.

Troi:
 Are any Romulan ships around?
 Have scanners said that they've been found?
 Or is it Borg or some new threat
 We haven't even heard of yet?
 I sense no malice in this crew.
 Now what are we supposed to do?

Crusher:
 Captain, please, the Indrans need us.
 They cry out, "Help us, clothe us, feed us!"
 I can't just sit and let them die!
 A doctor MUST attempt -- MUST try!

Picard:
 Doctor, please, we'll get there soon.

Crusher:
 They may be dead by Tuesday noon.


*COMMERCIAL BREAK, COMMERCIAL BREAK
 HOW LONG WILL THESE DUMB ADS TAKE?*


Worf:
 The saboteur is in the brig.
 He's very strong and very big.
 I had my phaser set on stun --
 A zzzip! A zzzap! Another one!
 He would not budge, he would not fall,
 He would not stun, no, not at all!
 He changed into a stranger form
 All soft and purple, round and warm.

Picard:
 Did you see this, Mr. Worf?
 Did you see this creature morph?

Worf:
 I did and then I beat him fairly.
 Hit him on the jaw -- quite squarely.

Riker:
 My commendations, Klingon friend!
 Our troubles now are at an end!

Crusher:
 Now let's get our ship to fly
 And orbit yonder Indran sky!

Picard:
 LaForge, please tell me we can go...?

Geordi:
 Yes, sir, we can.

Picard:
 Then make it so!


                THE END
