        A few months ago, Howard Stern hosted Julie Cailini ('96 Playmate
of the Year) and Stacey Sanchez ('97 Playmate of the Year) for a morning
of sordid joviality. The ladies, who were promoting their latest
calendars, answered ten questions from Howard, ostensibly to demonstrate
how important it is for them *AS ROLE MODELS* for young women to stay up
on current affairs. Love him or hate him, you have to appreciate Howard's
sense of the absurd.
