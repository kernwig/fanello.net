Saw this sign by the roadside at a monument company.  (For those who
don't know, a "monument company" are the people who carve tombstones.)

From the Wall St. Journal 4/25/91...

Due to the high cost of and lack of space for burials, cemeterians [people
who manage/administer/own cemeteries] have come out with a new slogan:

        "Make Money the Modern Way.  Urn it!"

True story:

Many years ago (well, a few) I came home from a business trip and showed my
wife a bumper sticker I bought in the airport.  It said:

  "More people died in Teddy Kennedy's car than at 3 mile island"

(See, I'm pro Nuke and my wife isn't)

She replied "Years from now, dozens of people my die at 3 Mile Island"

I asked, "Is Teddy kennedy going to drive a busload of secretaries there?"

She HIT me!

Subject: A visit by *which* queen?

From a local radio station last week:

During her visit, the queen was introduced to the
director of the acclaimed movie ``Dances With Wolves''
[Kevin Costner].  She said ``I find it quite
interesting to meet you.  I have a cousin who is a
photographer, you know.''  To which Kevin Costner
replied ``And I'm quite happy to meet you; I have a
cousin who's a queen, you know.''

"A House committee, ignoring White House pleas, voted to kill Freedom...."
        
(Note from Ant: Back before we joined up with the Russians, the station
was named Space Station Freedom.)

Quoting from an article in the JPL "Universe", a weekly newsletter--

 "Field tests have begun on an airborne system to map wildlands
 fires being created for the U.S. Forest Service by JPL."

My reaction:  Why can't they create their own damn fires?

176 lb amateur boxer looking for sparring partner.  No experience 
necessary.  

I'll pass.

A conversation I unwittingly had with another CS major in the back row
of the SPARC room in the computer science building, appropriately
named "Foo Hall":

We had both logged on to different SPARCs, and we were waiting for any
signs of life -- a prompt, anything! -- but of course the fileserver
was either down or far too overloaded to accommodate us, as usual.

Her: "Seems like it's pretty tight today.  How far can you get in?"

Me: "I'm hung pretty well.  We've just got to wait for it to come up."

It took a few discreet stares from the people around us until we
realized the implications of this exchange...

Yesterday a scruffy man extended a plastic cup towards me and asked if
I could spare $50,000.  I figure he used to be a lawyer.

As I was crossing the street on the way to my math final this morning,
I saw a truck owned by the "Guaranteed Overnight Delivery"
Corporation, or G.O.D.  On the back of the truck was written "For
service, call 1-800-CALL-GOD"

Subject: No where but Wisconsin.....

During the recent(national reported) food warehouse fire near Madison,
Wisconsin, there were a few occasions for chuckles:

The first was the local TV interview with an offical of the EPA, with
a concertedly puzzled look on his face. His comment: We've dealt with
environmental contamination from chemicals, and of course, oil...umm,
but never from butter.

Also: Other places, like Alaska and New Jersey, have oil spills, but
only in Wisconsin would you have a CHEESE SPILL.

**NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED**

Nike Commercial Just Doesn't Do It

Dr. Lee Cronk, an anthropologist at the University of Cincinnatti who
spent two years in Kenya studying the Samburu tribe, took particular
note when he saw a new commercial for Nike running shoes.  The
comercial depicts Samburu tribesmen running in northern Kenya.  The
camera slowly pans down to show them wearing new Nikes.  One of the
tribesmen speaks in the Maa language, and a subtitle flashes Nike's
latest slogan: "Just do it."  Not exactly a literal translation, said
Cronk, who knows the language.  "What he is really saying is, 'I don't
want these.  Give me big shoes.'"

"I don't think he had anything against Nikes.  I'm sure he thought they
were great shoes.  I don't see why they should change it.  It is
really kind of harmless."
