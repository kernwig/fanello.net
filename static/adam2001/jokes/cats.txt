
All I Need to Know, I Learned
       from My Cat!

 
1.  Life is hard, then you nap.
 
2.  Curiosity never killed anything
    except maybe a few hours.
 
3.  When in doubt, cop an attitude.
 
4.  Variety is the spice of life:  one
    day ignore people, the next day
    annoy them.
 
5.  Climb your way to the top - that's
    why the drapes are there.
 
6.  Never sleep alone when you can
    sleep on someone's face.
 
7.  Find your place in the sun -
    especially if it happens to be on
    that nice  pile of warm, clean
    laundry.
 
8.  Make your mark on the world - or
    at least spray in each corner.
 
9.  When eating out, think nothing of
    sending back your meal twenty or
    thirty times.
 
10. If you're not receiving enough
    attention, try knocking over
    several expensive antique lamps.
 
11. Always give generously - a small
    bird or rodent left on the bed
    tells them, "I care."
 
12. When you go out in the world,
    remember :  "Being placed on a
    pedestal is a RIGHT, not a
    privilege"
