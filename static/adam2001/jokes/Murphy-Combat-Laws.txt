
   MURPHY'S LAWS OF COMBAT OPERATIONS
   ==================================
 
- You are not Superman.

- Keep it simple, stupid.

- Automatic weapons, aren't.

- Recoilless weapons, aren't.

- Suppressive fire, won't

- Incoming fire has the right of way.

- If the enemy is in range, so are you.

- Don't look conspicuous, it draws
   fire.

- If it's stupid and it works, it ain't
   stupid.

- When in doubt, empty your magazine.

- The easy ways is always the mined
   way.

- Try to look unimportant, they may be
   low on ammo.

- Professionals are predictable, it's
   the amateurs that are dangerous.

- Teamwork is essential, it gives them
   somebody else to shoot at.

- Never draw fire, it irritates
   everyone around you.

- Anything you do can get you shot,
   including doing nothing.

- No combat ready unit ever passed
   inspection.

- No inspection ready unit ever
   passed combat.

- Never share a foxhole with someone
   who is braver than you are.

- If your attack is going really well,
   it's an ambush.

- No battle plan survives contact with
   the enemy.

- Your weapon was made by the lowest
   bidder.

- The enemy diversion you are ignoring
   will turn out to be the main attack.

- The only thing more accurate than
   enemy incoming fire is friendly
   incoming fire.

- When you have secured an area, don't
   forget to tell the enemy.

- Make it tough enough for the enemy
   to get in, and you won't be able to
   get out.

- A sucking chest wound is nature's
   way of telling you to slow down.

- If you're short on everything but the
   enemy, you're in a combat zone.

- The enemy invariable attacks on only
   two occasions - when you're ready
   for them and when you're not.

- Suppressive fire only works on
   abandoned positions.
