Subject: OJ's Statements to Judge Ito 

After months of silence, OJ finally spoke at the trial.  His words to 
Judge Ito were.. "I did not,
could not and would not have committed this crime.

Seems with a little help from Dr. Suess and a bit more time, he and 
Judge Ito could have
extended this statement:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ito's statemets in ALL CAPS... OJ's in lower case.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DID YOU DO THIS AWFUL CRIME?
DID YOU DO IT ANYTIME?

I did not do this awful crime.
I could not, would not, anytime.

DID YOU TAKE THIS PERSON'S LIFE?
DID YOU DO IT WITH A KNIFE?

I did not do it with a knife.
I did not, could not, kill my wife.
I did not do this awful crime
I could not, would not, anytime.

DID YOU LEAVE A POOL A BLOOD?
DID YOU DROP THIS BLOODY GLOVE?

I did not leave a pool of blood.
I can not even wear that glove.
I did not do it with a knife.
I did not, could not, kill my wife.
I did not do this awful crime
I could not, would not, anytime.

I do not like green eggs and ham
I do not like them Sam I Am
