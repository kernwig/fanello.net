 which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will

Subject: An uplifting experience

The maths/physics/computer science building at
Auckland University was built in about 1970, and
in a typical penny pinching maneuver, obsolete
lifts were installed. As these are now 20 years
old, and spare parts have probably been
unavailable for much of that time, they are, to
say the least, unreliable. Your life flashes
before your eyes whenever you enter one, and an
office mate of mine maintained (over my
objections) that there are no Atheists in lifts. I
lived in constant dread that I would get stuck in
a lift when I needed to go to the toilet.

Anyway, one morning I came in and found that both
lifts were operating flawlessly. (As opposed to
the more common event of operating floorlessly.)
They opened the doors smoothly, they weren't in
their homicidal "close the doors again before they
even completely open" mode, they weren't in their
"sulk in the basement" mode, when they stopped,
you could get out without stepping up or down 30
cm and they took less than one minute between
floors. Inspired by this unprecedented event, I
went up to my office and soon returned to the
lobby with a notice:

"Due to circumstances beyond our control, both
lifts are fully operational. We apologize for any
inconvenience. Normal service will be resumed as
soon as possible."

Sure enough, next morning the sign was gone, and
an engineer had disassembled lift spread around
the lobby for repairs.

From the New York Times, 3 April 1991:

BRITON JOKES ABOUT 5 YEARS IN IRANIAN JAIL

    Looking tired and gaunt but sporting a sense of humor, Roger Cooper, a
British businessman who was held by Iran for more that five years on spying
charges, arrived in Britain yesterday after being released unexpectedly 
from a high-security prison in Tehran.

    Playing down his ordeal, he said, "I can say that anyone who, like me, 
has been educated in the English public schools and served in the ranks of 
the British army is quite at home in a Third World prison."

Subject: novel treatment of low back pain

From the New England Journal of Medicine, March 7, 1991 (Volume 324 Number
10):

To the Editor: I wish to report the serendipitous discovery of a
symptomatic treatment for low back pain that, until now, has been
underutilized.  Six months ago I evaluated a 48-year-old retired
airline pilot with a two-month history of ... [unrelated complaint
deleted].  ... he had ... and responded quickly to ... On a follow-up
visit at six months, he reported continued control of the facial pain
but described an exacerbation of his chronic, intermitted low-grade
lumbar back pain.  On examination, he had a mild restriction of
forward bending, mild paraspinous muscle spasm, and no neurologic defects.

When asked about factors that aggravated or relieved his pain, he
related that the only maneuver that attenuated the symptom was flying
upside down in his rebuilt open-cockpit biplane, suspended by the seat
belt and shoulder harness. This treatment had to be administered in
repeated brief bursts, since the aircraft operated on a
gravity-dependent fuel-injection system; after 10 seconds upside down,
the engine would stall and need to be restarted during a dive.  On the
other hand, his back pain was aggravated by prolonged flying in the
usual (right-side-up) position.  In fact, the current exacerbation was
attributed to a recent flying trip with his wife, during which she
would not permit him to fly upside down.

This case raises a number of interesting questions, not least among
them being issues of risk-benefit ratios, cost effectiveness, and even
utilization review, assuming that fuel costs may be reimbursible by
the patient's third-party insurance carrier...  In any case, the time
is ripe for a study comparing this approach with the use of
gravity-inversion boots.

My wife is a new CS professor, and since she is new she teaches lower-
level courses.  One of her classes is in "Computer Literacy", which is
a course to explain computers to non-majors.

Sadly, some of these people don't pay a lot of attention in class and
try to guess answers to test questions; this week's midterm earned one
of the most original guesses ever:

Question:  Name one advantage of tape as compared to a hard disk for
           storing data.

Answer:    Can listen to it.

From "Unisys World   Network Computing News"  March 1991   Vol 9, No 3

"... the Symmetry 2000 achieved a record performance rate of 354 transactions
 per second on a 16-CPU system.  The benchmark yielded a cost per transaction
 of $8100, including five-year cost of ownership ..."    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

And I thought $0.15 per check was bad!

The following was written and is currently being used as resume cover 
letter by my buddy Dennis Jennings:

 To whom it may concern:

Well hello there prospective new employer!!! Lookin for that perfect
new employee? One that's smart enough to get the job done but not
smart enough to take your job? Well I'm your man!! Yup, I'll be your
very own sychophant and will do all those nasty, dirty little jobs
that you don't want to do or just can't do cause you're a tad short
in the smarts department. When the big boss compliments you on how 
much you've improved (even though we know it was because of me) I'll
stand right there and say how terrific you are! Am I good? Yes! Am I
cheap? Of course! Do I know my place? You know I do BOSS! So c'mon,
give little ol dj a call and get that career of yours back on track!
I'll be waiting to hear from you!

 Sincerely,

A new TV ad for a Lexus automobile touted a new leasing agreement 
where Lexus will pay for all scheduled maintenance costs for
two years or 30,000 miles, whichever comes first.
The ad finishes with the announcer saying:

  "Just what you've always wanted: a short-term, no-maintenance
   relationship."
