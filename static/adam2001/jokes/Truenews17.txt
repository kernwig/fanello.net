[Note - What follows is one part of the True News Digest - a collection of
 true-life stories which didn't really warrant individual posting, but
 which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will
 appear in 22 parts over the next few months - ed.]

Working as a student consultant at the University of Vermont, I just had
this little gem happen:

 A girl walks in wanting the latest version of Disinfectant.  I smile
and ask her if her Mac has many viruses.  She laughs and replies "Gee,
I probably have more viruses than my computer!"

Subject: Rodeo Stimulation & Cattle Prod Joke

I heard this from a friend of mine, who won't allow her name to
be used. She says it's original with her, and wasn't meant to be
a joke:

While watching TV coverage of a Rodeo, one of the announcers happened
to mention that some bull riders, in an effort to make their bulls
more 'animated', poke them in the rump with a cattle prod. Thinking
that this was cruel to the bull, she stated: "I guess some people will
do anything for a buck."

Subject: Grandma got run over by a raindeer - true story

My wife overheard the following story:

This woman's grandmother dies of natural causes right before christmas
and while the arrangements are being made at the funeral home, the
funeral director suggests that the grandmother's favorite christmas
carol be played during the viewing.

The woman/grandaughter breaks into laughter.

Husband:  Why are you laughing?  That's not funny - it's a beautiful
suggestion.
Woman:    It is a beautiful idea, but that's not why I'm laughing. Her
favorite carol was: "Grandma got run over by a raindeer..."

Subject: A true sportsman

I guess that this indicates a true sportsman.
A few days ago, my 9 year old son won a gold medal in a
cross country ski race.  After the awards, he didn't
seem to be very happy.  

I asked him, "What's the matter Jean-Philippe, aren't you
happy with our medal?"

"No," he said,  "I already have a gold and silver one.
I wanted to win a bronze this time."

SUBJECT Out of sight, out of mind!

This is NOT a joke.  I repeat, this is NOT a joke.  This appeared on a
poster hanging in the Wakefield, MA Public Library (my hometown). The
poster was advertising "Tupperware Home Parties," and they listed some
of their more attractive points:

   WE COOK, FREEZE, STORE,
       AND KEEP THE KIDS ENTERTAINED
         WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL TOYS

Now, wouldn't you think that cooking, freezing, and storing kids would
be ENOUGH entertainment?

Heard this one in a commercial for Thieves Market ( a "low price" shoe
and boot seller here in SoCal) where they were claiming to have a "real"
sale, not like those others:

"Hey, it's our final going-out-of-business sale!  You better hurry,
because we can't keep going out of business like this forever!"

Subject: Talk about pain!

The following headline and subheadline appeared on a genuine news
article in the New York Times on Sunday, January 19, 1991 (at least
in the edition I received):

   CLOSED BEACH TIED
      TO MAN ON BARGE
        ----------
Authorities Say Crew Member
 Takes Pain-Killer for Back
        ----------

[The article was about a barge worker who was taking pain-killing
medicine and tossed his used syringes into the water; they washed up on
the beach and authorities closed it.]

Subject: Real losers

I was somewhat astonished to see, as I scanned this morning's "Chicago
Tribune", a quarter-page ad proclaiming, in huge type,


LOSE ALL YOUR WEIGHT FOR ONLY $68 *


After trying to visualize the "After" pictures, I checked the footnote:


* Weight Loss Weeks only (up to 100 lbs.)


Well, that's a relief.
