Every Rep down in Congress liked Clinton somewhat,
Except for the Gingrinch, who simply did NOT/

He hated Bill Clinton/ He hated his wife/
He vowed to torment them the rest of his life/

The Ging hated anyone left of the Huns,
He hated the wusses who didn't like guns.
He hated the teachers who wouldn't lead prayers,

He hated the people who'd tax millionaires/
He hated "McGoverniks" whining 'bout rights,
Like equal protection for gays and nonwhites.

He hated the folks who said "Nicotine kills"
And vowed he would pass more pro-nicotine bills.
He hated the folks who said "Women need choice"
And vowed to give middle-aged males more voice.
But he hated the people on welfare much more;
He hated the way they were POOR POOR POOR/

He hated the way they had no jobs at all/
This struck him as heaploads of GALL GALL GALL/
They also lacked training and day care. So what?
The Gingrinch announced he'd come up with a plot:
"Get off of Welfare/ Get off today/
Or we will take all of your children AWAY/"

Now, no one knew what made the Ging such a meanie:
It could be because he was built like a weenie.
It could be because he had Donahue hair,
Or maybe because not much lurked under there.
But probably what most explained the man's life
Was the fact he abandoned his children and wife.

Yes, 'way down in Georgia, his wife lay near dead
Sickened with cancer, in hospital bed.
He crept in to see her (they let him, of course)
And whispered, quite sweetly, "I want a divorce/"
He whipped out his pencil with something like zeal
And got down to work on his alimony deal/
And while she was whimp'ring he said, "By the way,
I'm leaving for somebody younger - hooray/"

The Gingrinch's heart shrank two sizes that night.
And that could be what makes him so Christian Right.

Now, the night before Congress the Ging hatched his plans:
>From now on he'd speak for, quote, "Normal Americans."
Tax-slashers/ That's what those "Normal" folks love/
He'd take to the skies and dismantle the gov/

He jumped out of bed and he summoned his pet:
A doberman pinscher who once killed a vet.
George was his name (as in Wallace, not Bush);
Boy/" said the Gingrinch, "We're gonna whip tush/"

They flew to a soup kitchen, filled with sad "bums,"
Snatched up the kettle and stole all the crumbs.
They flew to a basketball game late at night
And shooed the kids out, to the dealers' delight.

They unplugged mass transit and cried "Buy a car/"
Then chopped down a forest and chomped a cigar.
What bliss/ What fun/ What downright glee/
What joy/ What yuks/ What great TV/

The next day the Gingrinch sat high above view
And looked down on Congress (as many folks do).
He wanted to relish the joy and the cheer
Of folks waking up to their first tax-free year.

He waited and waited and waited some more;

He waited to hear them cry "Newt/ Take the floor/"
He waited for kudos and champagne free-flowing,
He waited for trumpets on high to start blowing.
But instead of rejoicing and hoopla, etcet,
He heard a strange rumble that made his palms sweat.

The people weren't happy, not happy at all/
They ringed 'round the Statehouse/ They filled up the hall/
They groused and they grumbled and cried, "We're real mad/
We want all those costly old programs we had/
Give back our givebacks/ Give back our pork/
Give back the stuff you walked off with, you dork/"

And the Gingrinch sat simply quite stunned at the sight
Of Normal Americans, not left and not right.

They wanted clean air and they wanted green trees,
They wanted-full coverage for medical fees,
They wanted nice schools and streets safe to play,
They wanted it all - they just  didn't want to pay/

And when the truth hit him, the Ging grinned a grin,
He laughed and he laughed till the tears ran down his chin.
The Clintons climbed up to the Dome, laughing too.
"Hee hee hee," Bill and Hill laughed, "Hoo hoo hoo/"
They laughed with the cheer that comes from within,
They laughed with the knowledge: You just cannot win.

The Gingrinch and Clintons now shared the same plight
Whatever they'd do, they could not do it right.
"Folks hate you," said Bill, "once you land in D.C.
But I've got a plan: Let us bond, you and me.
We'll work as a team, yes/ That's my advice/
We'll listen and nod and make NICE NICE NICE/"
The Prez put his hand out, they hugged on the ledge...

And then that old Gingrinch pushed Bill off the edge.
