       Re: AUTO INSURANCE CLAIMS
 
 
    The following quotations were taken
from an out-of-state newspaper.  They
are samples of comments that
individuals wrote down on their claim
forms following their auto accidents:
 
- I misjudged a lady crossing the
  street.

- Coming home, I drove into the wrong
  house and collided with a tree I
  don't have.

- I collided with a stationary
    streetcar coming the opposite
    direction.

- The other car collided with mine
  without giving warning of its
  intentions.

- I heard a horn blow and was struck in
  the back...a lady was evidently
  trying to pass me.

- I thought my window was down, but
  found it was up when I put my
  hand through it.

- My car was stolen and sent up a
  human cry, but it has not been
  recovered

- I collided with a stationary truck
  coming the other way.

- The truck backed through my
  windshield into my wife's face.

- A pedestrian hit me and went under
  my car.






- The guy was all over the road.  I had
  to swerve a number of
  times before I hit him.

- If the other driver had stopped a
  few yards behind himself, the
  accident would not have happened.

- In my attempt to kill a fly, I
  drove into a telephone pole.

- I had been shopping for plants all
  day, and was on my way home.  As I
  reached an intersection, a hedge
  sprang up, obscuring my vision.  I
  did not see the other car.

- I had been driving my car for 40
  years when I fell asleep at the
  wheel and had an accident.

- I was on my way to the doctor's with
  rear-end trouble when my universal
  joint gave way, causing me to have an
  accident.

- My car was legally parked as it
  backed into the other vehicle.

- An invisible car came out of nowhere,
  struck my vehicle, and vanished.

- I told the police that I was not
  injured, but on removing my hat, I
  found that I had a skull fracture.

- I was sure the old fellow would
  never make it to the other side of
  the roadway when I struck him.

- The pedestrian had no idea which
  way to go, so I ran over him.

- The indirect cause of this
  accident was a little guy in a
  small car with a big mouth.

- I was thrown from my car as it left
  the road.  I was later found in a
  ditch by some stray cows.

- The telephone was approaching fast.
  I was attempting to swerve out of
  its path when it struck my front
  end.

- I was unable to stop in time, and
  my car crashed into the other
  vehicle.  The driver and passengers
  then left immediately for a
  vacation with injuries.

- I pulled away from the side of the
  road, glanced at my mother-in-law,
  and headed over the embankment.
