
Fish and visitors stink after 3 days.

How few there are who have courage
 enough to own their faults, or
 resolution enough to mend them!

A country man between two lawyers, is
 like a fish between two cats.

There are three faithful friends....an
 old wife, an old dog, and ready money.

If passion drives, let reason hold the
 reins.

To err is human, to repent divine; to
 persist devilish.

They who have nothing to trouble them,
 will be troubled at nothing.

Keep conscience clear....then never
 fear.

Doing an injury puts you below your
 enemy; revenging one makes you but
 even with him; forgiving it sets you
 above him.

If you would have guests merry with
 cheer, be so yourself, or so at least
 appear.

The worst wheel of the cart makes the
 most noise.

Necessity never made a good bargain.

There's many witty men whose brains
 can't fill their bellies.

Half wits talk much but say little.

An open foe may prove a curse; but a
 pretended friend is worse.

'Tis easy to see....hard to foresee.

Quarrels never could last long, if on
 one side only lay the wrong.
