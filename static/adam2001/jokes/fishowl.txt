      Owl's First Fishing Trip

 
     One time Squid took Owl fishing.
He was an old hand at it but not Owl.
So he baited her hook, showed her how
to cast, how to wiggle the bait and all
that.

     Well, sure enough, Owl hooked a
nice one.  When she pulled it up to the
boat, she looked over the side and
announced:

     "He's a giant.  Must be at
least twelve inches."

     Squid laughed like crazy, "You
call that big?  A twelve incher? Why,
he's just newly spawned!  A baby
thing!  Twelve inches!  Ha!  Ha! Ha!"
  
     "Tiny?" Owl replied.  "You call
that tiny?  That twelve inches is
between the eyes!"
