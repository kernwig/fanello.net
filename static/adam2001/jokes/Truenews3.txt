Subject: Security Check

[From the 1991/1/30 issue of Dagbladet, Oslo, Norway. -Bjoern]

Mr Trygve Hildebrand, director of a psychiatric clinic, had to escort
someone aboard an airliner. With the increased security at the
airports, due to the increased terrorist threats, he expected to be
asked to show some identification, so he took with him two letters.

Letter number 1:
 
        CONFIRMATION

 It is hereby confirmed that my name is Trygve Hildebrand, born
 1940/12/22 and director of the Children's Psychiatric Clinic,
 Gravdal Hospital at Lofoten.

     Gravdal 1991/1/15
     Trygve Gravdal
     Director


The letter was rejected, but his second letter, signed by his
secretary, was accepted by the security guards.

_Releasing your inner senior citizen_
To heck with that inner child, let's work on discovering and
releasing that cantankerous senior that lives in us all. 
Get seats on the bus! Hit people in the shins with your cane~
Pretend you can't hear people when they are talking to you.
Group forming soon.

Subject: All we wanted was some food!  (True, original)

Romanelli's is the local Italian food delivery place.  Tom and Bob work in 
the computer center here and we were all hanging out on the evening shift.  
We are hungry.

Me:  (phone dialing action)

Romanelli's:  Hello, Romanelli's.

Me:  Yes, we'd like a chicken parm sandwich, a sausage sandwich, and an
antipasto salad. 

R: We have no sausage sandwiches.

Me:  No sausage, Bob.  What do you want?  

Bob:  Uh, chicken I guess.

Me:  Okay, 2 chicken parms and an antipasto salad.

R:  Two chicken parms and an antipasto salad.  Where to?

Me:  Drew University Academic Computer Center.

R:  That's in Brothers College? 

Me:  Yes.

R:  You're in the computer room?

Me:  Yes.

(now, this is the weird part)

R:  What systems are you running?

Me:  (Huh?)  Um, mostly Vaxes.

R:  You got Ethernet and Decnet?

Me:  Yes.

R:  What else are you running?

Me:  We've got LAT also.

R:  TCP/IP?

Me:  Yeah, we just installed some Ultrix Workstations.

Tom (to Bob):  He hung up a minute ago.  He's making this up.

R:  3100s?  2100s?

Me:  Yeah, some of each.

R:  What kind of stuff do you do there?

Me:  Mostly comp sci programming and math stuff.

R:  Any IBM stuff?

Me:  Yeah, we have lot's of PCs, but nothing larger.

R:  No IBM mainframes?

Me:  Nope, no mainframes or minis.

R:  I only work here part time for financial reasons, I really 
work in telecommunications.

Me (suddenly somewhat understanding):  Oh...

R:  It'll be about 30 minutes.

Me:  Thanks.  Goodnight.  (to Tom and Bob)   No, guys, he really was there!  
This isn't his real job, he said he works in telecommunications!

You know, I don't think Tom and Bob believe me... but it really happened, I 
swear!  Could I have made this up?

Subject: What a bargain!

I was driving through sunny downtown Waltham, Massachusets when I passed a
restaurant that had a sign proclaiming this bargain:

We have Senior Citizens, 10% off, Monday-Friday 10 a.m. - 2 p.m.

Subject: How to Stop Procrastinating

This is taken from a review article in the Times Literary Supplement
printed on January 22, 1982, by George Steiner, on the life and work of
Hungarian radical Georg Lukacs:

"When I first called on him, in the winter on 1957-8, in a house still
pockmarked with shellbursts and grenade splinters, I stood speechless
before the armada of his printed works, as it crowded the bookshelves.
Lukacs seized on my puerile wonder and blazed out of his chair in a
motion at once vulnerable and amused: `You want to know how one gets
work done?  It's easy.  House arrest, Steiner, house arrest!'"

Subject: A Quality report?

From a draft copy of a Student project group report (quoted exactly):

Quality exelence is best achieved by preventing problems rather than
recifying them after they occure. it is the aim of the company toproduce
zero defects by getting it rigt first time.

Subject: Causes of the Civil War

This was heard during a pledge break on our Public TV station WQED-TV
Pittsburgh
during a recent showing of the documentary "The Civil War".

 "...and we'd especially like to thank all of our members
  who right now feel very proud to know that it was
  people like themselves who made the Civil War happen..."

I'm not sure whether to agree or disagree...

Subject: Humorous Airline Speech

The recent posting from a SouthWest Airlines ad reminded me of an incident
which occurred on my last SouthWest flight back from Las Vegas.

The flight crew was going through the normal pre-flight 'safety' speech,
and of course no one was paying attention.  Out of the corner of my ear
I heard

   If you are sitting next to a child or someone who is acting like
   one, please secure your own mask before assisting them with theirs.

I looked up in surprise at the stewardess with the microphone, who saw
my look and smiled.  Looking around the plane, I think I was the only one
who caught it...
