friend Cliff.)

Here is a true story someone found regarding exams at Cambridge
University. It seems that during an examination one day a bright young
student popped up and asked the proctor to bring him Cakes and Ale.
The following dialog ensued:

Proctor: I beg your pardon?

Student: Sir, I request that you bring me Cakes and Ale.

Proctor: Sorry, no.

Student: Sir, I really must insist.  I request and require that you
         bring me Cakes and Ale.

At this point, the student produced a copy of the four hundred year old
Laws of Cambridge, written in Latin and still nominally in effect, and
pointed to the section which read (rough translation from the Latin):

"Gentlemen sitting examinations may request and require Cakes and Ale".

Pepsi and hamburgers were judged the modern equivalent, and the student
sat there, writing his examination and happily slurping away.

Three weeks later the student was fined five pounds for not wearing a
sword to the examination.
