The New York Times notes that the Lord's Prayer contains 56 words, the
23rd Psalm 118 words, the Gettysburg Address 226 words, and the Ten
Commandments 297 words, while the U.S. Department of Agriculture
directive on pricing cabbage weighs in at 15,629 words.

I like it when grocers in the check-out line try to make friendly small 
conversation.

One time I bought a can of lighter fluid and some orange juice concentrate: 
"Mmmm, Having a barbeque tonight, huh?"
"No.  Mixed drinks."
The bagger busted up laughing.

Subject: Apologies

   I have several students working for me, doing early morning system
backups.  One in particular had immigrated to the United States.  He
is a brilliant and dedicated person, and he had been raised to be very
polite.

   One early morning I got a call from him about a problem (early
morning problem calls are a routine part of my job).  He was very
apologetic about waking me up, and expressed concern that he hoped I
would not get mad at him for it.  I laughed it off, and told him that
wake-up calls are part of my job.  After we resolved the problem, he
again apologized for waking me up, and we hung up.

Later that day, I ran into him on campus...

"Hi.  I'm sorry I woke you up this morning."

"No problem.  That's what I get paid for."

"Well, still I'm sorry. I hope you're not mad at me."

"Look, I'm not mad at you.  But if you don't quit apologizing, I will
get mad at you."

"Oh...," and in all seriousness, "well, I'm sorry I apologize so much."

   I couldn't help myself.  I burst out laughing.

From an Associated Press story in the Kansas City Star, 6/12/91:

FORT WORTH, Texas -- A shooting victim was declared dead and sent to 
a morgue, where a worker found him still breathing and sent him back to 
the hospital, investigators said.  The victim was put on a respirator but 
soon died.

"It was nobody's fault," said James Kirkpatrick, a medical examiner's
investigator.  "He was sent over a little early."

  The company official social organization often sponsors various events
for employees. I was looking at the schedule and noted that on Jun 22
the event will be the New York City Opera doing _A little Night Music_,
while the following night the event is _Hulk Hogan vs. Sergeant
Slaughter_.

Subject: Another use for Print Shop

Seen in a local Dairy Queen:

A small piece of yellow typewriter paper with the unmistakable Print Shop
type graphics/font on it.  The graphic was an Ice Cream Bar.  The text said
GOOD FOR ONE FREE DILLY BAR.  Next to the piece of paper was written:
"Do NOT accept these."

I have to wonder how many of these passed through before a manager
caught it.

Subject: an economist led recovery

An article in `The Age' newspaper 13/6/91 discussed the increase in numbers
of skilled workers leaving Australia in the last couple of years.
It ended with an optimistic footnote:

To every cloud, however, there is a silver lining.
In 1985-86 there was a net loss of only three Australian
economists. In 1989-90, however, we had a very favourable
trade balance, exporting 60 more Aussie economists than
we took back. This might be just what the economy needs to
recover from their advice.

Subject: Name of a small town

   There is a small town in Western Maryland, called "Accident".  This
raises all sorts of fun possibilities.

   For instance, the founding fathers were wise enough to _not_ put a
road nearby named "Purpose".  Can you imagine calling for a tow truck,
and trying to tell them, "Hi.  I ran out of gas by Accident, on
Purpose, but I didn't mean to."

   There is a small business in this town that sells ambulances,
Accident Ambulance Service.

   Really - no joke.  Accident, MD is just north of Deep Creek Lake,
on U.S. Route 219.

Subject: Dangerous symptoms...

My roommate works at the local animal shelter.  Since we live here in the
progressive (:->) town of Chapel Hill, this animal shelter actually has an
emergency rescue service for animals, replete with a special van outfitted
with animal carriers as well as an around-the-clock hot line used to
dispatch volunteers at any time of the day or night.  Volunteers are
typically assigned shifts of two or three day stretches -- such as 
weekends -- and carry a beeper and a mobile phone so that they can be 
easily reached.

Anyway, recently my roommate was talking with another volunteer, whom I'll
call "Hugh".  Hugh related that he was on duty one weekend and got a call 
in the early evening from a woman saying that her dog had been hit by a 
car. Hugh hurriedly drove the van over there to see a small pooch 
cavorting happily around the lawn.  Hugh stopped the animal long enough to 
give it a quick examination, and could discover no serious injuries 
-- broken bones, dislo-cations, signs of internal bleeding, stuff like that.  
The only thing he found was a small cut on the dog's lip.  He released the 
dog, which went back to playing, and he told the woman that there didn't 
appear to be any serious injuries and that the dog looked fine.  The woman 
had been somewhat distraught,
so Hugh added, "If he starts acting strangely, just let us know and we'll
come right back out."  The woman thanked him and he left.  Apparently, 
end of story.

Not quite.  Hugh goes to bed that night, gets awakened at 2 AM by a call. 
It's the woman.  She's concerned about her dog.  Hugh asks why.

The woman answers, "He's acting sleepy."

"We will be using 3 different methods for studying.  Some people like
to learn by indepth study of the _meaning_ of the language contained
in the manuscript.  Others like to use commentaries written by experts
who have studied the manuscript.  And finally, others like to learn by
practical discussion and comparison, often volunteering personal
anecdotes from thier own experiences."

From page 7 of the Adelaide "Advertiser" newspaper, 01-Jul-1991, (and
probably lots of other newspapers throughout the world), in the world
news section:

"Grenades Fly In Chicken Row
----------------------------
PESHAWAR, Pakistan: A dispute over a chicken escalated into a pitched
battle in which four people were killed, after two Pakistani tribal
families tried to settle the row with rocket launchers and hand
grenades. The clash occurred after the bird flew to a nearby house
whose owner laid claim to it."
