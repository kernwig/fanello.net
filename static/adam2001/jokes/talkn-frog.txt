A boy and his frog

A boy was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said,     

"If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess."                        

                                                                              

He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket.                    

                                                                              

The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss  me and turn me back into a    

beautiful Princess, I will stay with you for one week."  The boy took the     

frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket.           

                                                                              

The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a Princess,    

I'll stay with you and do *anything* you want."  Again the boy took the       

frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket.                       

                                                                              

Finally the frog asked, "What is it?  I've told you I'm a beautiful           

Princess, that I'll stay with you for a week and do *anything* you want.      

Why won't you kiss me?"                                                       

                                                                              

The boy said, "Look, I'm a computer programmer.  I don't have time for        

girlfriends, but a talking frog is really cool."
