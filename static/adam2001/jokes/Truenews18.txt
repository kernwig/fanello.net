[Note - What follows is one part of the True News Digest - a collection
of true-life stories which didn't really warrant individual posting, but
which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will
appear in 22 parts over the next few months - ed.]

Subject: Kids are literal

A few years ago our son, when he was about 3, was getting into the
habit of leaving the table before finishing his food and without first
excusing himself.

In the course of sternly correcting him on one of these ocassions, I
told him "...and don't get your tail out of that chair until all your
food is gone!"

A sudden look of desperation crossed his face and he tearfully replied
"But Dad, I don't *have* a tail."

From Bob Levey's column in the Washington Post, originally from a
Minnesota paper whose name I forget.

A mother hears her son in the kitchen with a firend looking for
something to eat.  Very apologetically he says:

  "My Mom doesn't buy food, she buys ingredients."

Subject: So what is VMS anyway?

About six months ago I discovered that a mischievous friend had put
a "VMS FOREVER" bumper sticker on my car.

The other day, one of my neighbors saw my car and asked me what VMS
was.  When I told him, he was rather surprised to find that it was a
computer operating system.  He had assumed that it was some sort of
social disease...

 I was sitting in a graduate level computer science class during a 
particularly incomprehensible lecture.  The instructor was speaking
far above the level of the class and no one would ask a question and
risk being considered ignorent.  Finally somebody in the front row
raised his hand.

"Excuse me," he asked the instructor, "Are you talking to US?"

True Story

  My grandfather, who spent his whole life in Maine, riding his horse
and not even doing much driving, decided late in his life, to visit his
sister in California.  He had never flown before.  When he got to the
plane he found that it was full of ministers on a charter flight to
LALA land.  He took his seat next to a minister, and the conversation
went like this:

   Minister: Good morning.
Grandfather:  Hello.
          M:  This is the first time I've flown.  I'm a little nervous.
              Are you?
          G:  Nope.
          M:  Did you buy any flight insurance?
          G:  Flight insurance?  What for?
          M:  Well, what if (God forbid) the plane should crash?
          G:  What do I care?  I don't own it.

I thought to myself "what a good idea!".

"I can't believe that the defense got away with calling King a bear.
The system is so screwed up if they'll let a man be dehumanized like that."

"Yeah, the pigs are just out of control."

Subject: how are horses like computers?

This really happened to some friends at work:

A horseback riding trip had been orgainzed and everyone was going
through the orientation, i.e. "anyone ever ridden (seen?) a horse
before?", etc.

Everyone's told: "It's simple.  The horses are all neck rein trained.
Hold the reins in one hand.  To turn left, move the reins left.  To
turn right, move the reins right.  If you pull back on the reins, the
horse will slow down, then back up.  To make the horse go, kick gently."

At this point, Mark (his real name!) sez: "Oh, I get it, it's a point
and kick user interface."

I just called New Jersey Bell to ask for a change in service.  I got a
recorded message, saying something like:

You have reached New Jersey Bell.  All operators are busy.
Your call is very important to us.  Please hold and an
operator will be with you shortly.

The line went dead, and a few seconds later I got a dial tone.  The
same thing happened when I tried again a minute later.  In between,
the line was consistently busy.

Gee, I'd hate to see how the phone company would treat me if my call
*weren't* important to them...

  I heard this one on KSFO radio in San Francisco.  It's a *true* story
out of Waco, Texas:

  This bank robber goes into a bank in Waco, and to get things started,
he distracts the clerk by handing him a twenty-dollar bill and asking
for change. As the clerk starts to do that, the robber pulls a gun and
tells the clerk to put all the money from the cash register into a bag.
The clerk tells the guy, "Ok, be cool, no problem," and does as the
robber demands.  Then the robber flees in a car, where he later opens
the bag to find... fifteen dollars in cash.
  And yes, you guessed it, he left the $20 bill behind.

This early exposure to recursion will no doubt lead many young ladies to
a life in computer science.  Or so I hope.
