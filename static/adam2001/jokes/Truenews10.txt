[Note - What follows is one part of the True News Digest - a collection of
true-life stories which didn't really warrant individual posting, but
which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will
appear in 22 parts over the next few months - ed.]

On the news this morning, Florida governor Chiles defended his state's
sale of 188 permits to hunters to kill up to 15 alligators each by
saying that the income would be used for the Alligator Protection
Program.  Protection from what?

I stepped into a fast food place for lunch the other day.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, to which the waitress replied: "Would 
you like bacon on that sir?"

I went to USC this morning doing my library search for articles on user
interfaces. I saw rows of computers set there for on-line data base
browsing. I sat there, logged in, chose Computer Science category,
typed in "user interface" as key word for subject and I got a list of
"hit records". One of the records says this: "Title: Do It Yourself --
Repairing Broken Windows."

Subject: machine names

I read this somewhere.

You know how most laundromats have a number on each machine?  At one 
apartment complex, they gave each machine in the laundry room a name, to 
make it easier to remember when reporting difficulties.  This led to the 
following note appearing on the superintendent's door:

 Alice gets hot but won't tumble.

   After a round of thunderstorms hit most of the USA on Tuesday, the 11 PM
news had an interesting report: the usual set of today's highs and lows,
rainfall amounts, and so on; a few satellite photos; some local interest
shots.
Then the weather guy got to the forecast: NONE.
   The National Weather Bureau's main forecasting station in D.C. was 
struck by lightning, taking out all their computers.  No data, no 
crunchers, no forecast.

   But we did have a red sky at night, and the satellite photos helped.

Background ->  I had ordered 5 CDs from Columbia House.  They only shipped
4, however, demanding payment before sending the fifth.  On the invoice
was stated:
"We must limit the amount of open charges.  We are,
therefore, holding SOME GIRLS until your balance has
been paid... "
I quickly submitted the ransom...

I called AAA to ask for an insurance quote, and their representative
said:

"I'm sorry, but the person I have available isn't available right now.
Could I have someone call you back?"

     For a few years a road near my parents house had the standard
"Speed Limit 35" sign, with a smaller sign underneath which read:

        "Speed monitered by ESP device."

     I really wonder what would have happened if someone had challenged
that in court.
