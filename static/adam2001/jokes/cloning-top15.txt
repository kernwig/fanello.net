     The Top 15 Potential Problems With Cloning Humans  
  
  
15> Harder than ever to land a role in those new Wrigley's 
    commercials featuring the Doublemint Octuplets.  
  
14> Two words: Gilbert Gottfried(s)  
  
13> Any scientific advancement that stems from the result of 
    Scottish people doing strange things to sheep is bound to 
    have dire consequences.  
  
12> In mere weeks, Bill Gates (v1.0, v1.2, v2.0, v3.0, v3.1 & v5.0)
    has all the money on the entire planet.  
  
11> Hillary's husband discovers true multiple orgasms.  
  
10> If you think there are too many idiots shouting "Show me the 
    money!" on every occasion now, just wait.  
  
 9> Rush Limbaugh takes his self-affection to a whole new level, 
    and suddenly is IN FAVOR of same-sex marriages.  
  
 8> "Penn & Penn & Teller & Teller & Teller & Penn & Penn & Teller 
    & Penn" much harder to fit on comedy club marquee.  
  
 7> And you think it's hard to find your size now!  
  
 6> 18-month waiting list for George Clooney and Cindy Crawford 
    clones.  
  
 5> "Alternative" radio filled with even more Nirvana clones.  
  
 4> And the final score: the New York Gretzkys - 408, the 
    Pittsburgh Lemieuxs - 399.  
  
 3> Can no longer count on the Grim Reaper to get Jesse Helms out 
    of office.  
  
 2> Those apocalyptic words: "Ladies & Gentlemen: The John Tesh 
    Philharmonic Orchestra!"  
  
  
    and the Number 1 Potential Problem With Cloning Humans...  
  
  
 1> Seventeen Mark Fuhrmans, and suddenly OJ's defense doesn't 
    seem quite as far-fetched.
