 
    Confessions of a Download Junkie
    ---------------------------------
 
  You know you are addicted to
     downloading, when.........
 
 1. You wake up, make coffee (maybe),
    then hit the BBS's

 2. You never read the bulletins on
    any BBS you log onto.  Okay.. if
    the Sysop threatens you, then you
    scan them real quick.

 3. You never read a single message on
    any BBS, maybe one or two, but you
    really never read them, you scan
    them.  And you hate to enter one,
    okay, maybe if it's a quick one
    that asks for a phone number to
    another BBS you call and download
    from. (This will keep your level up
    a little, right?)

 4. You download everything that is
    new, even if you don't understand
    what the program will do.

 5. Your download/upload ratio always
    seems to be on the edge.  Funny 
    how some sysops keep giving you
    messages to upload.

 6. You've downloaded the same file
    more than once.

 7. You've downloaded the same file
    more than twice.

 8. You've called the same BBS more
    than once in a day.  (I forgot).

 9. You've called the same BBS more
    than twice in a day.  (Hey! He
    might have gotten a new program in
    the last 15 minutes!)

10. You notice your hard drive is
    filling up with programs.

11. You can't remember what any of
    them are, or do.

12. You never even unzip them to see
    what the program is!

13. You have a closet full of unzipped
    disks (some dated back a year or
    two).  Okay... maybe just a few
    shoe boxes full.

14. You don't care if you ever unzip
    any of them.

15. You get your kicks from just
    downloading!  (You like looking at
    the bar graph.  Beats TV, right?)

16. You say to yourself, I'm a
    collector!!  (So.. you have a lot
    of out dated programs).

17. The wife's always saying, "Get off
    that #$%@ computer".

18. The grass is a foot high, but you
    have to get that NEW program.

19. Your neighbors ask your wife,
    "What's that beeping I hear all
    night?".  It's you, the download
    was successful! .. Thank God!! You
    really needed that one.

20. When you are on vacation you bring
    your lap top with you.  Hey!  They 
    might have something here you've
    never downloaded before.  Right?

21. You panic when anything happens to
    your modem.

22. You panic when anyone goes near
    your computer or modem.
    Hey!  Some people give off a lot of
    static electricity.  Don't they?

23. Your hard drive just crashed, your
    car needs a tune-up... the hard
    drive is in the shop, you'll
    tune-up the car yourself.. next
    week!

24. It's four AM.  Well I better go to
    bed now..  I have a bunch of files
    to download tomorrow.. I'm a
    collector you know!!!

25. Oops... is that the Sun rising, or
    somebody's headlights?
