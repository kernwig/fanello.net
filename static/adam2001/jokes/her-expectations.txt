    children.

 He will be a man of emotional and
    physical strength.

What she gets:
 
 He always takes her to the best
    restaurants. (Some day he may even
    take her inside.)

 He doesn't have any ulcers...he gives
    them.

 Anytime he gets an idea in his head,
    he has the whole thing in a
    nutshell.

 He's well-known as a miracle worker..
    it's a miracle when he works.

 He supports his wife in the manner to
    which she was accustomed...he's
    letting her keep her job.

 He's such a bore that he even bores
    you to death when he gives you a
    compliment.

 He has occasional flashes of silence
    that make his conversation
    brilliant.
