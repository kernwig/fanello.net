Mathematics contest.  Students were asked to finish the sentence "Math 
is like a box of chocolates..."  The grand prize winning entry was 
submitted by a sixth grader:

"Math is like a box of chocolates - it's best when you use your fingers."

(original, inspired by a recent r.h.f ballad on the subject)

 Those who claim that seeing things in movies does not affect what
people do in real life may have to reconsider their position: look at
what Lorena Bobbitt did after seeing "Free Willy"...

Subject: When she just wants to be friends

I was recently telling a friend of mine about a rectent romantic
endeavour. I told him that first she asked me not to push her into
making a decision on our relationship, but I couldn't wait, so she
turned me down.

My friend said "OK, so you backed off, then you backed on, and then you
were backed over."

Subject: A man walks into a bar 

Overheard on the New York subway:

It's 1972, and Jesus comes into a disco. He pays the cover, but he
just can't seem to score, every song that comes on he moves like a dead
white guy.  So after a while he takes a break, buttonholes the
bartender and says,

"Darn it!  I've risen, and I can't get down!"
