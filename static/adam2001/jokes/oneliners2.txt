Subject: More from the True News Digest 

What follows are the latest entries in the true news file.  These are true-
life stories - signs sighted, cute anecdotes, and news reports, all of 
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

	We were very busy last week. My wife was preparing for a book-signing
and library convention, I was building the displays, and we were pulling 
together all of the paperwork for the annual income tax battle. As a result, 
the home office was full of boxes and stacks of paper -- promo flyers, books,
business receipts, and tax forms.

	In the middle of all the confusion, no one had let the dog out. He
walked into the office, sniffed at the boxes, then raised his leg for a 
direct hit on the completed tax forms. At that point I was torn. Should I 
whack him with a paper and yell at him, or should I just tell him to move 
over and give me a chance at them? In any event, if we are selected for an 
audit, it should be entertaining.

    A few days before Christmas my car broke down while I was driving on
a long trip to my parents' house.  The shaft that supports the valve
rockers was broken.  I was in a hurry to get my car repaired so I could
get home by Christmas, but none of the repairmen or dealers in town had
the correct replacement shaft in stock.  One dealer had a used engine
and offered to use that engine's rocker shaft to replace the broken one.
 He wasn't going to charge me for the used part, but the labor was going
to cost alot.  His exact words were:

  " 'Tis the Season, so we'll give you the shaft for free "

The health insurance company that I'm working with has a closet near the

What worries me is that someone felt they needed to post a sign indicating 
that they are "For Emergency Use Only."

Raymond Cuthbert walked into Nolan's Pharmacy in Vernon, BC, on
Thursday evening and boasted that he was returning in half an hour to
rob them.

True enough, about 30 minutes later, he returned with Robert Phimister
carrying a concealed hunting knife... into the waiting hands of the
Mounties! whom the drug store employees had called after his boast.

Mountie Hugh Menzies said, "I don't know why he did it; he's well known
to the local police."

Went to my local BookStop yesterday to see if Skeptical Inquirer
was out yet.  Next to it were all kinds of weenie New Age/Alternative
Religion magazines, one of which apparently had an article on romance
and palmistry (for Valentine's Day, no doubt).  The headline on the
front of the mag was:

   "Find Love in Your Palm."

I didn't look to see if the author was Joycelyn Elders.

Completely true story ...

Country-music station KUAD-FM in Windsor, Colorado, played Jo Dee Messina's 
new song for the first time today (Saturday, July 13). In the middle of 
the song, the station broke in with an Emergency Broadcast System report 
of a tornado warning in Weld County, Colorado. Then it returned to 
playing the song.

The name of the song is "You're Not In Kansas Anymore."
