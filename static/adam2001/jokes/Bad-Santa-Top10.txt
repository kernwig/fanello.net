Top Ten Elf Pickup Lines
 
 1) I can eat my weight in cocktail
    wieners.

 2) You'd look great in a Raggedy Ann
    wig.

 3) I get a thimbleful of tequila in
    me and I turn into a wild man.

 4) No, no.  I don't bake cookies.
    You're thinking of those dorks
    over at Keebler.

 5) I'm a magical being.  Take off
    your bra.

 6) I have certain needs that can't be
    satisfied by working on toys.

    shoes doesn't mean I'm a sissy.
