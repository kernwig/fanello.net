Dearest John:
 
I went to the door today and the
postman delivered a Partridge in a
Pear Tree.  What a thoroughly
delightful gift.  I couldn't have been
more surprised.
 
With deepest love and devotion,
Agnes

Dearest John:
 
Today the postman brought your very
sweet gift. Just imagine, two turtle
doves.... I'm just delighted at your
very thoughtful gift.  They are just
adorable.
 
All my love, Agnes

Dearest John:
 
Oh, aren't you the extravagant one!
Now I must protest.  I don't deserve
such generosity.  Three french hens.
They are just darling but I must
insist.... you're just too kind.
 
Love Agnes

Dearest John:

Today the postman delivered four
calling birds. Now really!  They are
beautiful, but don't you think enough
is enough?  You're being too romantic.
 
Affectionately, Agnes

Dearest John:
 
What a surprise!  Today the postman
delivered five golden rings.  One for
each finger.  You're just impossible,
but I love it.  Frankly, John, all
those squawking birds were beginning
to get on my nerves.
 
All my love, Agnes

Dear John:

When I opened the door there were
actually six geese a-laying on my
front steps.  So you're back to the
birds again, huh?  Those geese are
huge.  Where will I ever keep them?
The neighbors are complaining and I
can't sleep through the racket.

PLEASE STOP!
 
Cordially, Agnes

John:
 
What's with you and those stupid
birds????  Seven swans a-swimming.
What kind of rediculous joke is this?
There's bird poop all over the house
and they never stop the racket.  I'm a
nervous wreck and I can't sleep all
night.  IT'S NOT FUNNY.......So stop 
with the birds already!
 
Sincerely, Agnes

OK Buster:
 
I think I prefer the birds.  What the
heck am I going to do with eight maids
a-milking.  It's not enough with all
those birds and eight maids a-milking,
but they had to bring their own cows.
There are piles of poop all over the
lawn and I can't move into my own
house.  Just back off, IDIOT!

Hey Butthead:
 
What are you?  Some kind of sadist?
Now there's nine pipers playing.  And
sheesh - do they play.  They never
stopped chasing those maids since they
got here yesterday morning.  The cows
are upset are stepping all over those
screeching birds.  No wonder they
screeh.  What am I going to do?  The
neighbors have started a petetion to
evict me.  You'll get yours.

December 23rd
 
You Louse:
 
Now there's ten ladies dancing - I
don't know why I call them ladies.
They've been fooling around with those
nine pipers all night long.  Now the
cows can't sleep and they've got
diarrhea.  My living room is a river of
poop.  The commisioner of buildings has
subpoenaed me to give cause why the
building shouldn't be condemned.  I'm
sicing the police on you.
 
One who means it, Ag

Listen Lunkhead:
 
What's with the eleven lords a-leaping
on those maids and aforementioned
"ladies"?  Some of those broads will
never walk again.  Those pipers ran
through the maids and then started
with the cows.  All 234 of the birds
are dead.  They've been trampled to
death in the process.  I hope you're
satisfied, you rotten swine.
 
Your sworn enemy, Miss Agnes McCallister
