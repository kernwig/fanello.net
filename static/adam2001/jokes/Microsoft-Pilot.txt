A pilot is flying a small, single-engine, charter plane with a couple of
really important executives on board into Seattle airport. The fog is so
thick that visibility is down to 25 meters, and his instruments are out.

He circles looking for some sort of landmark to guide him in and after an
hour, he is low on fuel and his passengers are *very* nervous.  Then 
finally, through a small opening in the fog he sees a tall building with
some guy working alone on the sixth floor.  Circling, the building the 
pilot shouts through his open window:

                             "Hi, where am I?"

The solitary office worker replies:

                         "You're in an airplane."

The pilot executes a swift 275 degree turn and a perfect blind landing on
the runway five miles away. Just as the plane stops, the engines cough
and die from lack of fuel. The stunned passengers ask the pilot how he 
did it.

"Simple," replies the pilot, "I asked the guy in that building a simple
question.  The answer he gave me was 100 percent correct but absolutely
useless; therefore, I knew that must be Microsoft's support office and
from there the airport is just 5 miles away on a bearing of 275 degrees!"
