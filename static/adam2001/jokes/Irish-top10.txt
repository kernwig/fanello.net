
Top 10 reasons it's good to be Irish:
 

10 ) No one expects too much from us.

 9 ) We can be grumpy bastards and
     people put it down to "that
     feisty Irish temprement"

 8 ) Every bar tender is your friend

 7 ) It's lonely at the top....
     ipso facto .... Irish people are
     never lonely

 6 ) You will never be asked to cook a
     Traditional Meal from back home

 5 ) Our Telephone book indexes are so
     simple, everyones name begins
     with "O".

 4 ) We sound exactly the same sober
     as we do drunk.  (This is still
     only theoretical since no one's
     ever found us sober)

 3 ) We've got the luck of the Irish.
     ( this was bestowed on us by God
     as an apology for our limited
     inteligence, our less than
     stunning looks, and, most of all,
     for the neigbours that he gave
     us.)

 2 ) When we emmigrate from Ireland to
     the U.S., we increase the IQ of
     both countries.

 1 ) We're not English.
