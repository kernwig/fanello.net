Gay Court is, or used to be, a street in the megabucks San Francisco
suburb of Alamo.  The county board of supervisors, citing homosexual
implications, social stigma and ridicule, officially changed the name
of the thoroughfare to High Eagle Road. [...]

Local gay activists responded with ingenuity and aplomb, announcing
that Bay Area homosexuals would henceforth refer to themselves not
as "gays" but as "high eagles."

My friend told me this...

   Tim was  a 8th grade student. He got 98 in the math test. His father
gave him 10 dollars in order to praise his effort.

Mother: Timmy, now you got 10 dollars in your pocket. How are you
going to plan to use it?
Tim: (Thinks for a while) I'll buy some candy.
Mother: Oh, be mature, hon.
Tim: (Thinks for another moment) Well, then I'll buy some beer.

    In a recent press interview, President Bush was asked to comment on
the on-going scandals in the US congress (i.e.  bouncing checks on
congress' bank, and not paying their tabs at the congressional
restaurants).

Bush replied: "You mean the checks and balances?"

I have heard this at least twice on United Airlines cross-country
flights:

stewardess over the load speaker:

"We will beginning our in-flight dinner service in a few minutes.  
There are two entres on the menu tonight: chicken in a red sauce, or 
beef in a brown gravy.  Because we don't stock 100% of each entre, 
please have a second choice in mind."

Subject: Articulation

This is an original, actual statement I made during the course of a 
genuine converstation I had with a friend, (yes, I'm gloating).

One night after hours and hours of study and fruitless attempts on my part
to write a paper, I ran into Brian, who asked after my state of mind.

"Oh, Brian," I sighed, "I'm feeling inarticulate."

Being the curious type, Brian inquired, "Oh?  How's that?"

He cringed and grinned simultaneously (quite a feat!) as I replied
"There are simply no words to describe it..."

In San Jose, CA there is a supermarket which has two doors.  On one door
is the sign "Open 24 Hours".  On the other door is a sign which reads:
"After hours use other door."

Thought you might like this....

Three things really bother me about the FAA.

one)   A plane crashed into a hotel.  The FAA reported that the crash 
caught most of the guests by suprise.  Which means someone was
saying, "You know Martha, I wouldn't be a bit suprised if a
plane crashed into this here hotel tonight...."

two)   In a particular case the FAA ruled that a plane crash was caused 
by the plane coming to close to the ground.

Three) A plane crashed after the tail stabilizer fell off.  Upon 
investigating the FAA found that forty-seven (47) of the fifty (50) 
screws that held the stabilizer on were missing, but they were not sure 
if that was the cause of the accident.

From the London -Independent-, 16 November (The Week in Review):

Alain Basseux, a laboratory technician, took umbrage at another driver
on a roundabout in Yorkshire, pursued him for two miles, and when he
stopped to call police on his car phone, yanked the door open,
threatened to kill him if he drove so inconsiderately again, then kicked
shut the door.

He was conditionally discharged for two years on Wednesday, after his
lawyer told the the court that such behaviour was customary in France
and that Mr Basseux had been mortified when he discovered his victim was
a director of the company that employed him.

NEWS OF THE WEIRD
=================

This is a true story.  A friend of my aunt was shopping in Green Bay 
recently. While driving home from a department store, the woman started 
feeling sick and hot and was turning purple and getting dizzy.  When 
she started having trouble breathing, she went to the emergency room of 
the hospital.  Nobody knew what exactly was happening, but they treated 
the woman for shock with antihistamines and other stuff.

Eventually the doctors found some scratches in her neck, and from the 
symptoms they concluded that the woman had suffered from a snake bite.
At first the woman didn't believe them.  How could you get bitten by a 
poisonous snake and not know it?!  But then she remembered...

<wavy-lines-flashback>
While trying on a winter coat at the store, the woman felt an annoying 
prick in her neck.  It went away with readjustment, so she thought 
nothing of it. She decided not to buy to coat, and put it back on the rack.
<wavy-lines-back-to-the-hospital>

From the hospital the woman called the store and told them the story.  Of
course they thought she was crazy, but they took the coat into a back room
and sliced it open anyhow.  Lo and behold!  There was a mother snake and 
three babies trapped in the lining!!!!!  Yikes!!  They must have crawled 
in and hibernated when the coat was assembled in Taiwan.

The woman was quietly awarded a generous financial settlement.

So folks, beware of coats made in Taiwan, and henceforth, before you try 
on anything new, throw it on the floor and stomp on it.

Subject: Father Christmas

Told to me by Ruth (my wife), who heard it from a friend
who says its true.

[cultural note: Father Christmas is the Australian equivalent of Santa 
Claus, St. Nicholas.  He (all of them) sit in special areas of 
department stores prior to Christmas to hear children's Christmas requests]

A little boy is taken to visit a department store Father Christmas by his 
parents.  The little boy sits on the old man's knee and tells him what 
gift he'd like.

A while later, in another store there is another Father Christmas.  The 
parents again encourage the boy to sit on his knee.

"What do you want for Christmas little boy?"

The boy shouts, "You old liar, I knew you'd forget!". 

He jumped off the man's knee and kicked him in the shin.

I was in a local video store during a power failure.  Guy behind me says
"Damn. I wish the tv would come on so we could get some news and find out 
how long this blackout's gonna last!"
"Hey, what's so funny?" was the next thing he said, as he saw the rest 
of us cracking up.
